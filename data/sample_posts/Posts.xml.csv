2014-04-22T17:52:09.743	6	cms^&^github	how do i contribute code to joomla 	i am aware that the code is managed at https   github com joomla joomla cms  for the cms at least  and that i should submit pull requests to suggest that code be added   i m especially interested in any good tips on managing my contributions and making sure that the code gets into the right place   should i use different branches in my forked repo to manage different contributions  if so  what is the best way to link that branch back to the main branches in the joomla repo   is there a good method to keep my forked copy up to date   any suggestions on a good flow for managing this process would be really helpful  	it s always good to have a dedicated branch for each pull request you are going to make   one of the simplest ways to create a up to date new branch is to just use the github web gui to edit the file in the original repository  when saving  github will automatically create a new branch in your fork based on the branch you currently edit  if you want to edit more files  you can edit them in your newly created and up to date branch   if you are a bit familiar with git  then you rebase your forked staging branch with the upstream original branch so it is in sync before you create new branches  also if you have to update a pr  it s recommended to rebase it instead of merging master  while both ways work  merge commits are just creating bad history and are harder to squash   generally speaking  prs should be  atomic   this means if you try to fix something  only fix that particular bug  don t fix two different bugs in the same pr and also don t do codestyle fixes  it s easier to test and also less likely to create conflicts if the pr lives a bit longer than expected   and of course add a good description of what you want to do and testing instructions to reproduce the issue and test your fix      one big thing that helps with grouping your contributions is to move each contribution into a separate  appropriately named  branch  if you re adding a feature  use a prefix like feature  and the add a one or two word feature description for the branch name  if it s a bug fix in the jform class  use bugfix jform   this makes it really easy to identify what you re working on by checking your git branches via git branch  a    
2014-04-22T17:55:53.433	8	overrides^&^update	how to keep overrides updated 	as many know  it is possible to override templates  views  modules  components   the main problem is when joomla  is updated  and the items overriden  in the template folder  get outdated   how do i keep the overrides updated each time an update is done to joomla   do i need to do it by hand and check each new update  or is there some other way to do this  	yes  you have to compare the files every time by hand and update the changes  on minor updates the chance is relatively small that you have to adjust them  but on major upgrades the overridden files can change significantly  i would also prefer an easier way  but it s the only solution atm   when joomla core is updated  no overrides in your template folder should be affected   that s why they exist   on core joomla items  overrides are going to only rarely conflict with joomla core updates     when you override the joomla core files  or any files  document document document   commenting in the override file is critical if this is going to happen to you regularly and you admin more than one or two sites   you just won t remember what you changed    your code editor should have a  diff  feature  to compare the new file to the old and identify line by line what changes were made   if you ve commented well  this diffing will show you exactly what was changed and if the file was affected by the update   your only changes should be your overrides    anything else and you do have to go and re override   third party overrides  however  become an issue only if the developer is not using the mvc structure correctly   if a component or module is laid out appropriately  the tmpl or view in question should not be affected by code updates    if there is a major feature shift in that extension  you ll definitely need to document comment and compare files    write a small script which calculates md5 of original files which you have done over riding   dump these file path and md5 into a file in your template whenever joomla is updated  run the above script again   check the difference in md5  if any then you need to check it out    tip  override the files only if those changes cannot be done by css overriding

2014-04-22T17:56:53.860	10	joomla-2.5^&^joomla-3.x^&^component	joomla component tool or scaffold 	i have created a couple of plugins for joomla 3 2 and have recently started on a component to manage apartment rentals  i was wondering if there is a framework out there that had the basic file folder structure already created with the files necessary to get a component going quickly   i don t want to have to recreate the wheel every time i start  and the files and classes necessary to get a component going have a basic necessary structure  is there one already out there   if there is not  which stock joomla component would be a good example to work from   edit  upon seeing the answers  i think maybe  framework  was a bad choice of terms  i am not looking for anything that has a codebase of it s own  i was lokking for something that has the file folder structure that is common to all joomla components and required to run  such as the controller  the views folder  the models folder  etc   what i am looking for should have no dependencies that are not already a part of the joomla core code   i found one for joomla 1 5 that had all the necessary files and all you had to do was rename the classes and files to match the name of your component and install and you would have a basic admin view  a front end menu view    etc    i am hoping someone out there created one for  	one tool that i ve used in the past is component creator  http   www component creator com en     this tool allows you to outline one table for free  more if you sign up for a paid package  as well as other general information on the component itself  you can then download an installable zip file to get the component started   for those that are happy jumping into the code anyway  this can be a great simple method to jumpstart the component development     there is also some extensions that you can install in joomla to help you develop other joomla components  one example of that style of helper is this free extension easy creator  http   extensions joomla org extensions miscellaneous development 5908  this can be a great add on for a testing environment mixed with a build tool in one nice package   have you taken a look at the joomla hello world component   i have not looked at it yet  but it looks like it has the minimum files needed for building a component  also since joomla 3 2 includes framework on framework  fof   have you looked at the to do fof example component  i know that i have writing a custom joomla 3 x component on my list of things to do and these were the two examples i was planning to use in beginning the project  hopefully  they will work for you too   i don t like to recommend any sort of  framework  for this sort of thing for several reasons   1  the cms has a  framework   and i wish if there was a need to make it  easier  to write extensions we would focus on the core framework code instead of writing 3rd party items    2  if you write your extension on a framework that goes defunct you re rather screwed    3  using the core is ideally going to make updates better  this has not always been the case which is why there are 3rd party frameworks for this  but the more we insist on it being the case and expect it to be  the more it actually will be  if we don t focus on it it ll never improve        so with that said  there is a  rad framework  in joomla called fof  framework on framework   i have not used it but it s said to be a time saving tool  there s some documentation on it here    https   www akeebabackup com documentation fof getting started with fof html  note   fof is included in joomla 3 2 s distro  so you don t need to install it if you re extension is for joomla 3 2     finally   if you are wanting to stay in the core and use the core mvc classes  currently it s still encouraged to use the legacy mvc classes  will be changing as soon as the new mvc is thoroughly sussed through   a good base extension to look at is really the com contact or com banners component  they re fairly simple and you can pick up on things like jform and custom models that way    i would highly recommend cook self service    i believe there s a small charge  but it generated about 85  of our major education component  saving  1000 s to get started with  and the code it generated was nice and clean for our modification   after writing numerous extensions for clients  i found myself following a lot of the same patterns over and over  to keep things dry  i created a  component framework  that abstracts away most of the common tasks that i do  but so far it s only been used internally at my company  it lacks a lot of features  but it gets the job done for what i need   i said that to say this   develop your own component framework in the same way  take the commonalities of the code you are currently producing  and move it up a level in the oo hierarchy into it s own layer that sits between your component and joomla  with this approach  you avoid the  if the framework goes bust  problem that chad mentioned  and you understand it that much better  it s worked well for me so far

2014-04-22T18:10:08.137	19	server-response-time^&^cache	improve server response time	what can i do  other than using a cache plugin like jotcache  to improve the server response time of my website   i have already removed all inactive articles modules  plugins and components  is there something else i can do to improve it   edit  i am talking about the time before the client  browser  gets a response to his request  and not the time the page loads  	you will want to also look into reducing local assets and proper caching  one thing that you can do is use cdn plugins  here are two i would recommend    corephp  jomcdn   https   www corephp com joomla products jomcdn  nonumbers cdn for joomla    http   www nonumber nl extensions cdnforjoomla  also if none of the above seem to resolve the issues you may have a deeper issue   possibly within your template  the server itself  or other things  if that is the case it might be best to hire someone to hunt down the issue and resolve it for you   i assume that you have run your site through google page speed  and you are indeed looking at reducing the page response time i e  time taken by your markup to be sent to the browser    the most likely culprits for these are heavy queries  turn on the debug and look at the bottom of the page to find out which are the most heavy queries and remove or reduce them  you can also take help of your mysql server s slow query logs    the next thing that you can look at is caching  depending upon the kind of site you have you can turn of conservative or progressive caching  progressive is to be used on sites that don t have and user related features   the things i know of that can help  most of which have been listed  are these    caching compression  gzip your css and js files  combining files  all your css gets combined into one file  offloading images and files onto a cdn    i ve used a combination of the built in joomla cache  or even apc enabled on the server  and plugins like gzip or rocket theme s rockbooster plugin  i also use nonumbers cdn plugin with an amazon account   it definitely helps  but you have to watch your site and disable the cache for components that have issues  i had to bypass civicrm on our site because it didn t play nice with caching  joomla comes with a cachecontrol plugin that can handle that   one big thing you can do to improve response times for your site is to update your module settings  custom modules  using mod custom  have an option to enable   disable the preparing of content  this allows you to run content plugins on the data content within your custom module  it s powerful when used properly  but it does add additional rendering time to the module output  unless you are actually making use of a content plugin within your custom module content  it s best to turn that off  you ll see an decrease in module rendering time when you do this   screenshot of the setting       note  if my answer helped you  please click the check to the left to accept the answer    there are several steps you can take to increase server side performance  do note that some of these will not work with most shared hosts  for great performance you usually need more fine grained control   as with any optimizations  you should measure the effect it has on your site s performance  for basic optimizations are tools like pagespeed and yslow helpful  i recommend the firefox versions   for a more in depth understanding you ll have to measure the actual response times of your live system over a period of time   php   enable opcode caching  this is probably the single biggest thing you can do to increase you site s performance  i recommend either using opcache or apc   the configuration of these caches can be tweaked for even greater performance based on the servers and sites specific needs  but just installing is already a huge boost  update php version  newer php version regularly come with performance improvements  additionally there are a number of cases where joomla can use better code when running on a newer php version  as of today you should not be using a php version older than php 5 4 if you care about performance  php settings  on older php versions     5 3  take care to turn off register globals and magic quotes gpc for a free performance win  on php    5 6 change always populate raw post data to  1  php extensions  joomla contains some code to workaround missing php extensions  this will always be slower than those extensions  for a decent performance improvement install the following extensions  mbstring   zip   ftp   webserver   enable gzip  enabling server side compression trades bandwidth for cpu resources  for most sites out there this is the right call  be careful to only compress text data  compressing binary data will give you the cpu hit without the bandwidth advantages  you can also enable compression in the joomla settings but it s better if you let the server deal with this  precompress static resources  i m not talking about minfication  though this helps too  but you can configure nginx and apache to server already compressed resources  effectively eliminating the cpu hit from gzip compression  bonus points  use zopfli for even smaller files  use fastcgi for php  more specifically you should use php fpm   this prevents starting up php when the browser requests a non php file  use appropriate cache headers  using expires header can greatly reduce the the server resources required  after all the fastest request is the one never done    apache  generally i d recommend using nginx for high performance sites  if you absolutely do need to use apache for some reason i got a bonus tip    disable allowoverride  setting allowoverride to none prevents a lot of disk io and    joomla   do not use the ftp mode  while it doesn t affect your users reading the site  it will slow down some operations like extension installation  turn off unused extensions  this goes especially for plugins  many of these are run on every request  disabling menus and components is mainly helpful when listing available extensions and menu types  also take 5 minutes to go trough the extensions that come with the joomla core and disable those you don t use  turn off prepare content  if you use a lot of custom modules   mod custom not custom as in self written  check if you can disable prepare content in those  this saves some processing  use caching  if you re serious about performance you ll want to enable caching  especially useful for read heavy sites with many anonymous users  logged in users will bypass most of the cache  if you have a lot of these the effect won t be as big  use an alternative session handler  by using an alternative session handler you can free your database for more important things  i d not recommend file  confusingly called none in the joomla settings  as that will bring once again increase disk io  using apc is potentially the fastet but increases the risk of loosing all session data  the right middle ground is memcache  while this requires an additional process  it s more reliable than apc and much faster than storing all the data in the database keep your site simple  do you really need that facebook button  what about that cute icon that no one ever sees because it s partly hidden behind some banner  the less your site displays the faster it will be  also wherever possible use css3 instead of images     miscellaneous   set a favicon  thank to a decision dating back to internet explorer 4 0 browsers make a request to a file called favicon ico whenever a user visits your site  if you don t have one this causes unnecessary io  as 404 responses are not cached  either specify your site s icon with a html meta tag or add a file called favicon ico to the web root  don t want a favicon  place a transparent png with a size of 1x1 pixel in that location  note that the extension still needs to be  ico   optimize your images  it s amazing what kind saving one can get by optimizing images  especially png files  there are a variety of tools available for any operating system  personally i use imageoptim which is available for os x  joomla s core images are already optimized but go trough your own images  especially templates are important  you could also check the extensions you are using  if they re open source  why don t you contribute a pull request containing newly optimized images    the advanced  if you really wanna go all out  consider putting varnish in front of your site  it caches requests to your site and if possible serves them from it s own cache  never hitting joomla  it s a complex tool but with a lot of power  joomla won t take advantage of advanced

2014-04-22T20:26:08.793	85	update^&^extensions^&^software-architecture^&^maintenance	what are the key differences between wordpress and joomla  s software architecture and how their core functions are extended 	 note   this is not a  which is better  question    wordpress and joomla  are both awesome open source cmss   what are the key differences  1  in the software architecture between joomla  and wordpress   2  in the way in which extensions to the core  out of the box  functionality are made  and  3  how the core and extensions are upgraded and updated  	i think to truly answer this question  you need to be extensively familiar with both wp and joomla   i m joomla  heavy and have only used wp a few times  so my answer may not be as full as you might hope   wp is first and foremost  a blogging platform   it s set up for feeds of data  you have to go out of your way to move past the feed default to get a regular static home page  it s not hard  it s just not default  if you know what you re doing  you can expand wp to move beyond the blogging platform  or if you download a template that has already done it for you   joomla is first and foremost  a cms  it s built to hold a complete website  including blogging  straight from it s base core  plugins help  they can get you a more customized experience for those who don t know how to create their own components and plugins  after all  why reinvent the wheel   in my experience  wp is great for people who aren t developers  or who know just enough  joomla on the other hand was built for developers  for people who want to create a fully customized front end and back end experience  i spent hours working in a wp template to force it to do what i wanted  which was frustrating when i m used to building things the way i want them the first time with joomla  we don t use templates   we have our own core joomla that s stripped down to the basics and we build from the ground up    if you pull up the ftp of wp and joomla side by side  you can see how very different they are   wp has this plugin area where you can search for plugins  choose and install   i believe you can also update from this same place  when you re in a plugin area  it will often tell you that an update is available   joomla uses extension manager where you can upload a downloaded plugin or component   i think there might be search functionality  but i honestly have never used it because i m usually using jed to find what i need  this same area also offers you an update button where you can see all the available updates for what you have installed   again  some components will tell you they have an update available  but not all of them   the key difference i see is wp is made for users   they install a template  they can update  they can add  joomla is made for developers  we do the installation  we do the updating  we build add new features and functions  that s not to say it s not user friendly  but there are areas that i think are pushed out of the user s way because they are built for developers   both wordpress and joomla  are highly regarded and each have there unique advantages when you compare them   to answer your questions   in the software architecture between joomla  and wordpress   joomla is oop  object oriented  and mvc  an object oriented design pattern   wordpress is written in procedural code    procedural programming specifies the steps the program must take to reach the desired state  whereas object oriented programming   oop   organizes programs into objects or data structures and methods together with their interactions   for simple programs  procedural code  think of a line by line sequence of commands  works great  but for large complex applications  procedural code can be harder to maintain   often resulting in what s called spaghetti code  i e  when the line by line sequence of commands starts using many gotos  exceptions  threads or other branching constructs and it s flow becomes conceptually like a bowl of spaghetti    in other words  procedural code starts off simple  but can become complex and tangled   more complex applications can therefore be better structured with oop and with mvc   a a more advanced style of programming that s much better suited to building really complex programs with a lot of moving parts   whereas procedural code may initially be easier to write and maintain for simple programs  oop has advantages in that it can neatly pull together collections of variables  called  properties  in oop  functions  called  methods  in oop  into bundles   resulting in code that is tidier  easier to read  maintain and extend   for most wordpress applications  e g  simple blogs   procedural code works perfectly well   for more complex applications  e g  those requiring user group permissions and those which use many integrate many extensions to extend features and functions   oop is generally considered a much more elegant approach   to sum up   worpress s software architecture  based on procedural code  has it s strengths in simplicity  but procedural code is not ideal for complex applications which robust extensibility   joomla  s software architecture  oop mvc  may seem more complex  but when well engineered  oop mvc actually makes it much simpler to extend an application s features and functions and to have all those extensions work together harmoniously   if you want to understand the differences  at a basic beginner level   read php procedural vs php oo vs php mvc by peham raza   he discusses the  ins and outs  of each in way that makes it easy to better understand the benefits   in the way in which extensions to the core  out of the box  functionality are made    joomla added features with module component plugins worpress uses plugin for it feature extending  joomla is strict in its module   plugin  or component creation you cannot simply upload the files via ftp and just activate  you have to do it with extension installer     how the core and extensions are upgraded and updated   both are using almost same technique for the upgrade or updates  they provide developers to create new features with extensions or template changes with override so basically no core files we need to edit on this situations so upgrade will improve their security patches and more     there is a saying wordpress is not a cms  but now days it is a cms with all the features of joomla and more   wordpress is good for users that have less development knowledge  and joomla for developers   hope its make sense

2014-04-23T05:00:02.280	132	cms^&^security^&^recommended-practices^&^file-permissions^&^linux	recommended practices regarding joomla file directory permissions and ownership on linux systems 	in the past i ve often run into trouble with permissions and ownership of joomla files directories on linux systems   problems included    not being able to transfer files to the server using programs such as winscp   not being able to install joomla extensions  plugins etc  insecure files and folders due to dangerous permissions and ownership settings    what are the recommended best practices for setting permissions and ownerships in joomla on linux systems  	please check the permission levels  it should be 644 and 755 for files and folders respectively   many times the permission levels are just fine  even when some issues are faced  it means that you will have to check the the ownership and group of the specific files and folders   normally the group and ownership can be changed to www data for apache  used in ubuntu based web servers    feel free to check out this interesting joomla document based upon verifying the file permissions   permissions should be 644 and 755 as explained by shyam   the problems you are facing are most likely related to the way your server is set up  most of the time this happens on shared hosts where apache runs under a different user than your ftp account  since you usually upload joomla using ftp  apache isn t the owner of the file and thus doesn t have the needed permissions to change it   there is a ftp mode within joomla which allows you to bypass this problem  you can enable it in the joomla global configuration  it will then do all file accessing using the ftp user instead of the regular apache user   a better way however is to ask your host to fix the issue  they can set up php  apache  to run under a special user  which in such a case should be your ftp user  then everything will work fine   permissions should be 644 and 755 as explained by shyam   in joomla you can avoid all the problems you mentioned  with following methods   not being able to transfer files to the server using programs such as winscp    this may happen due to permission of  444  like joomla configuration php have this permission its doesn t allow by default for security   another situation for this same error is when you transfer a site or folders from one server to another     not being able to install joomla extensions  plugins etc    this will happen due to temp log folder bad permission  it required 755  or another reason is temp log path is wrong in configuration php   insecure files and folders due to dangerous permissions and ownership settings    this is most important joomla always recommend do not use 777 for file and folder if you are not aware of this     hope its helps    an easy solution for me is to often let php run in  fast  cgi mode and to set the ownership of the joomla directory to the ftp user  so you will be able to upload and overwrite files via ftp and joomla will be able to write files too   a way to do this on a shared hosting environment  if it is allowed   is to add something like this to your  htaccess file   addhandler php53 cgi  php   also see an overview about the different modes    there are a few potential causes for file and folder permission issues on linux hosting   1  file and folder permissions  check folder permissions are set to 0755 and file permissions are set to 0644  note that file and folder permissions can be reset to these standard secure settings on a site wide basis using the free or the paid version of akeeba admin tools   2  php parameters  check the upload max filesize parameter in the php information tab in the system information is sufficient  you can often override the default setting in a shared hosting environment via a custom php ini file   3  incorrect paths in configuration php  you may have incorrect paths specified for the tmp and logs folders  these are specified in the system configuration or can be updated directly in the configuration php file if you are comfortable editing system files directly  if you are unsure of what the path should be  create and upload a file whereami php  or similar  to the root folder of your website with the following content     php   print  current folder is     dirname   file          browse to  mywebsite  com whereami php to see the path to the root folder   once you have the correct path  remember to delete the whereami php file   4  unsuitable php file handler  your web hosting may be configured with the default php file handler but should ideally be using suphp or fastcgi or similar so that joomla can upload and execute files using secure file permissions   you can see what php handler is being used at site    system information    system information    webserver to php interface    there is a good article on the relative merits of php file handlers at  http   boomshadow net tech php handlers  in a shared hosting environment you don t usually have access to change which php file handler is enabled but your web hosting company may be able to change this for you   sometimes as a work around  file and folder permissions are changed to 0777 but this puts your website in a vulnerable state and 0777 file permissions should generally be avoided   if your web hosting company can t enable suphp or fastcgi  the only other option might be to find a new web hosting company   5  disk space  check you have not exceeded your disk space quota   troubleshooting checklist     what are the recommended best practices for setting permissions and   ownerships in joomla on linux systems    see 1 and 4      not being able to transfer files to the server using programs such as   winscp    see 1  2  possibly 4  and 5      not being able to install joomla extensions  plugins etc    see 1  2  3  4 and 5      insecure files and folders due to dangerous permissions and ownership   settings    see 1 and 4   yes  the permissions should be 644 and 755 as explained by shyam  but the other posters forget to mention that this is if the file is owned by your webserver  and the group is the group you belong to    for instance  in filezilla you will see permissions something like this   filename      size   filetype  last modified          permissions   owner group somefile txt  11kb   txt file  2014 04 23 3 43 00 am      www data mygroup    the permissions drwxr xr x are 755  just ignore the leading dr so it s wxr xr x   read permissions are worth 4  write permissions are worth 2 and execute permissions are worth 1   so having them all add up to 7  and that s what the owner of this file has  the group has read and execute permissions but not write  so they have 5  and everyone also has 5   making the permissions 755    754 would be owners having read  write  execute  group having read and execute  and everyone only having read permissions     in the example above  you can see that the file owner is www data  which is the default web server group for many apache servers  and the group is the group mygroup  which is the group  admins  that i belong to    the first number is the owners permissions  the second is the groups  permissions  and the third number is everyone s permissions  obviously  you have to be careful to give the web server the permissions it needs    and make sure the files that need to be locked down can t be written or executed by just anyone  the third number    below is what the numbers mean    assuming the webserver owns the files  your admin is in the group  and of course  everyone is the third number    644  files with permissions set to 644 are readable by everyone and writeable only by the file folder owner   755  files with permissions set to 755 are readable and executable by everyone  but only writeable by the file folder owner   777  files with permissions set to 777 are readable  writeable  and executable by everyone  don t use this set of permissions  for security reasons  on your web server unless absolutely necessary  and only temporarily  it s a disaster waiting to happen  especially if a directory has those permissions   it means anyone can upload files and execute them    here are the linux commands to setup the joomla  recommended permissions from the command line  recommended joomla file permissions  set ownership    sudo chown  r www data myname  path to your domain com set directories  sudo find  path to your domain com  type d  exec chmod 755       set files        sudo find  path to your domain com  type f  exec chmod 644         note   many people will show you these commands without the path  but i prefer to always use the complete path  because if you forget to change directories to the root joomla  installation directory and run them without the path  you have just changed permissions for every file and directory in that top directory  and created a huge mess    after you run these commands  you will need to fix permissions for any directories that need more permissions    for instance   users uploading images etc    if you only use the joomla  interface  and you don t have admin or ftp access to the server  then use the ownership and permissions above    stop here if you are a novice   the below is only for people that truly understand what permissions and ownership do    however  i find having the ownership and permissions that way very unhandy because i like to use filezilla and a terminal session command line most of the time  and i upload a lot of files manually  but i can t overwrite any files because i don t own them and i don t have permissions to write  i could have filezilla log in under the web server account  but    i want filezilla to log in under my account  so i can browse other directories also  not just the files the webserver has access to    so    i change the ownership and permissions to this       filename      size   filetype  last modified          permissions   owner group     somefile txt  11kb   txt file  2014 04 23 3 43 00 am  drwxr xr x    myname www data  i make myself the owner  and put the web server in the group    and i change the permissions for directories to 775  and for files to 664  makes my life a lot easier    but i don t recommend it for everyone    if you do it my way  these are the commands    set ownership    sudo chown  r myname www data  path to your domain com  set directories  sudo find  path to your domain com  type d  exec chmod 775        set files        sudo find  path to your domain com  type f  exec chmod 664

ajax call inside it to retrieve some data  what is the proper way to do it  	abstract  there is almost no really official way of dealing with this  it much depends on the complexity and how much you want to rely on the mvc pattern to do the work   below are some possible solutions what should work in joomla 2 5 and 3 x  the code is not presented for a copy   paste job but rather as a general idea   prior to joomla  3 2 the only thing you need to use the examples below is a component   after joomla 3 2  for lower complex tasks  you can handle request from modules and plugins     generic html response  following legacy mvc   your url for the task needs to look like this   index php option com similar task abc format raw  you than create the controller which will use the view  let s say abc   which will contain the file view raw html  identical to a normal view file    below you have the code for generate a raw html response    controller php    public function abc             set view         joomla 2 5     jrequest  setvar  view    abc              use jinput in 3 x       this  input  set  view    abc         parent  display         views abc view raw php    php defined   jexec   or die   jimport  joomla application component view     class similarviewabc extends jviewlegacy       function display  tpl   null                parent  display  tpl              views abc tmpl default php    php  echo  hello world from  views abc tmpl default php     note  this is the solution i would use if i had to return html  it s cleaner and follows joomla logic   for returning simple json data  see below how to put everything in the controller   subcontrollers  if you make your ajax request to a subcontroller   like   index php option com similar controller abc format raw  than your subcontroller name  for the raw view  needs to be abc raw php    this means also that you will   may have 2 subcontrollers named abc   if you return json  it may make sense to use format json and abc json php   in joomla 2 5  i had some issues getting this option to work  somehow the output was corrupted   so i used raw     valid json response  following new   legacy mvc   if you need to generate a valid json response   check out the docs page generating json output     we assume that the whatver you do was a success   response   array  success     true      you can also return something like   response   array  success     false   error     could not find            get the document object   document   jfactory  getdocument        set the mime type for json output   document  setmimeencoding  application json        change the suggested filename  jresponse  setheader  content disposition   attachment filename  result json      echo json encode  response     you would generally put this code in the controller  you will call a model which will return the data you encode   a very common scenario   if you need to take it further  you can also create a json view  view json php   similar with the raw example     security  now that the ajax request is working  don t close the page yet  read below   don t forget to check for request forgeries  jsession  checktoken   come in handy here  read the documentation on how to add csrf anti spoofing to forms    multilingual sites  it may happen that if you don t send the language name in the request  joomla won t translate the language strings you want   consider appending somehow the lang param to your request  like  lang de       joomla  ajax interface  new in joomla 3 2    enabled you to make handle requests without building a component  joomla  ajax interface    joomla now provides a lightweight way to handle ajax request in a plugin or module  you may want to use the joomla  ajax interface if you don t have already a component or if you need to make requests from a module your already have   valentin s answer is good    i prefer a json controller that handles the encoding and error handling for this i created a json base class   class itrcontrollerjson extends jcontrollerlegacy           var array the response to the client      protected  response   array       public function addresponse  type   message   status 200         array push  this  response  array         status      status         type      type         data      message                          outputs the response       return jcontrollerlegacy void         public function display           response   array         status     200         type      multiple          count     count  this  response          messages      this  response             echo json encode  response       jexit             this controller get extended by the controller class that do the work  something like this   require once   dir    json php    class componentcontrolleraddress extends itrcontrollerjson     public function get          try         if   jsession  checktoken              throw new exception jtext     jinvalid token    500                  app   jfactory  getapplication            id    app  input  get  id   null   uint          if  is null  id             throw new exception  invalid parameter   500                   db   jfactory  getdbo           query    db  getquery true          query  select              query  from     table           query  where  id      db  quote  id           db  setquery  query          response    db  loadobject            this  addresponse  message    response  200          catch  exception  e           this  addresponse  error    e  getmessage    500               this  display            and you call the request like this   index php option com component task address get format json id 1234 tokenhash 1   the token hash get generated by jsession  getformtoken    so the complete complete call could be look like this    link   jroute     index php option com component task address get format json id 1234   jsession  getformtoken     1   false     the second parameter is set to  false  so we can use this in javascript calls without xml rewrite   valentin answer is good but is a bit overly complex if all you need to do is add 1 or 2 ajax calls to a component that is already built  it s perfectly possible to get away with not making separate controller raw php or view raw php files   to make this ajax call  index php format raw option com example controller job task keep alive tokenhash 1   in the job subcontroller  public function keep alive          this  ajax check           do your processing and echo out whatever you want to return to the ajax call     header  http 1 1 202 accepted   true  202       echo  ok        jfactory  getapplication    close          verifies jtoken and does a basic check that this is actually an ajax call private function ajax check         if  jsession  checktoken  get       isset   server  http x requested with       strtolower   server  http x requested with         xmlhttprequest             header  http 1 1 403 forbidden   true  403           jfactory  getapplication    close              if you are 100  sure there s no thrid party plugin adding any javascript output  a pure json encode works ok   but     for example jomsocial adds    to the whole site   so    a handy trick  wrap json encode with tags  and process it on javascript side   echo   start     json encode          end      this is a late answer for this very well answered question  but i wanted to add this cut to the chase solution for those that just need a simple way to get to their components s data with an ajax call   with all the joomla versions  3rd party possibilities  and hacks that i found over several days of googling  this was the simplest approach i could come up with   and feedback is definately appreciated    added function execute to my existing main controller created a subcontroller with a public function for the task s  i wanted to call with ajax used the built in joomla jresponsejson class to handle the output   it s really nice      url to call execute the task   www mysite com index php option com example task forajax mytaskname  modified main controller  com

2014-04-23T18:54:39.090	216	performance^&^joomla-3.x^&^responsive-web-design^&^mobile-web-design	how can a module be disabled based on device or viewport size in joomla 3 to optimize performance for mobile devices 	i m a proponent of responsive web design in conjunction with adaptive web design  i e    one design that adjusts display for all devices and provides content based on view port size  as opposed to separate  mobile  sites designs   there are some drawbacks  for example  on large displays i d like to include some modules which will be hidden for smaller viewport sizes   however  in the case where a module is hidden based on viewport size  loading and executing that module causes a needless performance hit when it is known that the specific module will never be displayed at a smaller viewport size   how can i use viewport size to effectively disable a module  i e  stop it from executing  in order to speed up performance  	i don t think you should be disabling modules like that and still call it responsive design  part of the point with responsive is that it will respond to changes of viewport and not just that it prints out a different layout for different screen sizes    depending on the example screen sizes it s possible that a tablet in portrait mode will cause the module to not load but then that same tablet might need that content once in landscape mode   advanced module manager   http   www nonumber nl extensions advancedmodulemanager   allows you to assign modules based on browser type  so you could select mobile  or desktop  or specific device  it doesn t allow you to choose by size  however  so it s only useful to a degree   it may also be possible with a combination of php and javascript  i ll send this question to my buddy  he might have an idea   this is a js class i made some time ago that could use javascript to detect viewports  it has never been put through rigorous testing but works   function resjs        this min   0      this

                     return this                    this leave   function callback               var context   this              jquery window  on  resize  function                    if context

600       enter function min max           console log min max  enter                leave function min max           console log min max  leave              breakpoint has min max parameters for width  then a chained function for entering it and leaving  with a callback to run some js code   i cannot go in detail on how it works  as i made it so long ago but your free to use it if it will help  this can be used to load modules through ajax based on the viewport  i believe joomla s com ajax can be used with this to make some really cool features   if you want to speed up performance then don t load modules that are unnecessary   if it isn t necessary on small screens then it also isn t necessary on larger screens   people with larger device displays also want a fast website that doesn t load unnecessary cruft  you are making the erroneous assumption that larger screens have more bandwidth available  they don t   be a good designer and give all your users an optimised site experience  irrespective of their screen size

2014-04-23T19:45:09.230	223	php^&^error-handling^&^jerror	whats the correct way for exception handling 	in joomla core i find still many calls like this          check for errors      if  count  errors    this  get  errors                   jerror  raiseerror 500  implode   n    errors            return false          but jerror is deprecated since platform release 12 1  so how should i use standard php exceptions  	most code blocks like this can simply be replaced with enqueuemessage since they are not actually acting on the error and simply using jerror to print them out      check for errors  if  count  errors    this  get  errors           foreach  errors as  error            jfactory  getapplication    enqueuemessage  error   error              here is how i m managing an errors   view or controller  try        this  item    this  get  item      catch  exception  e        if   e  getcode      404                   not found         throw new exception  e  getmessage    404                 generic errors     jfactory  getapplication    enqueuemessage jtext     com mycomp error occurred     error        so if i get a 404 code from my model  for example    if  empty  data         throw new exception jtext     com mycomp error message not found    404       then i catch it in the view or controller and throw one more exception that joomla will handle and will display 404 page  for any other i just show some generic error message to the user   also read this interesting discussion about errors handling   as  dmitryrekun said  a good discussion is here   the key piece to consider in all of this is what type of error do you have   there are two types of errors    recoverable unrecoverable    the difference i tend to sum up as follows   can i still show the page that was requested  even though this error occurred     yes    recoverable no    unrecoverable     now that we know what we are dealing with  what should you do   if the error is unrecoverable  you want to redirect them to an error page instead of continuing on to the requested page   that is as simple as the following   throw new exception jtext     com mycomp error message not found    404     exception is a class that takes two parameters  a message and a code  it is recommended to try to use the http response codes if they fit your scenario   if the error is recoverable  you likely just want to display a message back to the end user while still showing them the page that they requested  this typically means that you should  enqueue  a message for the application   jfactory  getapplication    enqueuemessage  error   error      enqueuemessage takes two parameters  the error message and a message type  more info here  at the bottom      there is also a third situation that occurs fairly often for me at least  joomla will throw exceptions for different errors  such as a database query error   this means that joomla thinks that this error is unrecoverable  however  you may want to continue on anyway   for example  if i m altering a table on update of my extension  i can just run the alter query  which will throw an exception if the table has previously been altered    in that case  you want to wrap the code that might throw an exception in a try   catch section   try          exception generating code     throw new exception  normally you would have other code that calls a class that throws the exception   500     catch  exception  e         msg    e  getmessage       returns  normally you would have other code         code    e  getcode       returns  500       jfactory  getapplication    enqueuemessage  msg   error       commonly to still display that error     note that what you are doing is  catching  the unrecoverable error and forcing the system to recover and continue showing the requested page     add all this up and your case should be an unrecoverable error   i know this because you have  return false  afterwards  so you likely don t plan to continue and are giving up on the function    thus i would rewrite this as follows      check for errors  if  count  errors    this  get  errors           throw new exception implode   n    errors   500       return false     you can remove this too  technically since the exception will take you out of this function      
2014-04-24T02:21:58.227	236	cck^&^chronoforms	is chronoforms a content construction kit  cck  	i have been using chronoforms long before i heard the term  content construction kit   by defining a form and choosing the option to save the results to the database  i can create new tables  store various types of fields including images etc and build applications    i have found very few limitations with chronoforms so have not had much incentive to check out any ccks   i am wondering if chronoforms does everything a cck can do or should i be learning about zoo  seblod  cobalt  k2 or flexicontent etc  	i think that s it s probably pretty hard to identify from a architecture or database design standpoint how chrono or perhaps fabrik are  different  from k2 or flexicontent or anything else  in my opinion all these things do the same thing  store data in a database and give you the ability to customize the way that data is interpreted and presented for display and for input  basically you re down the interface look and feel of how that input or display is done  the data is stored in a way that is pretty unimportant   that said  i think that  real  ccks or ccks that market themselves as such have at least a few features i consider important  url routing  user friendly interfaces  shared category structures  acl  and templating   now   i m sure a lot of those things i mentioned can be done in chronoforms  i use fabrik but i consider both tools to be pretty similar so i am basing my opinions on my experience with that  personally the routing in fabrik isn t so hot  also adding things like acl or categories is completely possible  but it s not so intuitive or  baked in  as these other ccks have it    in the end   you can get away with either approach as a way to develop custom content types and output   i wouldn t get too caught up in the semantics of what makes a cck different from a  application architecture  tool   i d focus on what you need to get done and which tool gets you there the fastest    i haven t used chronoforms  but i have used k2 and zoo  both of them feel like they re made to overcome some shortfalls with the stock article system  they both use  items  instead of articles  and then you can  nearly infinitely  expand on what that article can display by adding things like extra fields and 3rd party plugins  such as google maps   think of it as a very customizable article system   with k2 you can style categories and even override the output greatly and all the articles in each category take on that format and style  there are also some great filtering modules available that can use both tags and extra fields to sort the results   since you can completely customize the output  you can create loads of extra fields in the back end  plus images and image galleries   populate it there  and then have them display the data in a custom layout on the front end    with joomla 3 x and tags  plus some 3rd party custom field plugins you can get closer to this with the stock articles  but it s not quite there yet   i have no idea how close this is to chronoforms  but the name  to me  denotes it s made for gathering info on the front end  while zoo can do this  and i assume k2  but i ve never done it   i don t feel like that s the primary function of these ccks   there no clear term what cck is  so it depend from point of view     cck term comes from drupal  where the module with the name cck  that was made for extend the node  by adding extra fields   so from this point of view chronoforms is not a cck  because it do not extend the  content in joomla    also this means that joomla  have no real cck  only seblod more close to it   chronoforms is a forms component  which can also be used to customise the login process  or create simple payment gateway processes  it s not a cck  but you can create some of the functionality using chronoconnectivity which allows you to create your own tables  and hence data structures     my personal opinion is that there are better cck tools out there  for what it s worth  my favourite is k2  it s more user friendly than a lot of the others and is reasonably extendable out of the box  certainly  if you just wanted to create a listing if widgets with custom fields  it s really easy to get going

2014-04-24T09:24:39.183	251	component^&^extensions^&^development	when will the jxxxlegacy classes be deprecated 	is there any estimated time frame for the validity of jmodellegacy   jcontrollerlegacy and jviewlegacy    when will the switch to native 3 x ones occur   	so technically you start transitioning to the new mvc classes now   there s nothing stopping you  for example com config in joomla core is already using the new mvc classes   however as you probably know the jxxx classes are pretty much empty so a lot of the work will be putting in the same level of code as in the current jxxxlegacy classes  this will mean that when you write a component you should need to write as little code as possible    that s where i come in   i m going to be writing a full set of jxxx classes for  probably  j3 5 probably as part of joomla s gsoc campaign this year  2014   this will also involve swapping a lot of the components over to use those new  hopefully weblinks  newfeeds and contacts for an example for 3pd s as well as some of the more internally used components such as cache    however note these classes will not be available in j2 5 which means if you are building a j2 5 3 x compatible extension then you will not be able to use them  in terms of removal   i suspect we will remove the legacy classes in j4 0 however this is not a given   we may even choose to keep them until j5 in order to give extension developers plenty of time to make the transition

2014-04-25T06:23:21.770	299	cms^&^recommended-practices	what is an efficient way to troubleshoot a  white screen of death 	quite a few times i have been in a position where the front end of a joomla website is a blank screen with no content  sometimes known as a  white screen of death    this has occurred after a website has been moved and it has also occurred unexpectedly on a previously functioning website   assuming that there can be various different causes  what is an efficient way to troubleshoot and fix this issue  	 change error reporting to maximum   login to admin area  go to global configuration    server    first you need to set the error reporting to maximum edit files in ftp   login to your joomla site files via ftp  find your index php file located in the root of your site  open the index php and add this code directly after the very first line of the file   ini set  display errors   true   error reporting e all      edit php ini file  in php ini file you need to change these two settings    set display error to on   display errors   on set error reporting  error reporting   e all    e notice    e strict  check your server log  finally you get an error log with the error message showing the error path    error reason    reference   http   www ostraining com blog joomla white screen of death   in those cases just turn on the joomla error reporting to the maximum as shown below   once the error reporting is active try reloading the webpage  it will now show you some error sentences  actually you have just found the first information that needs to be debugged to get the error resolved   more basic debugging tip can be found in this blog   http   www readybytes net blog item a beginners guide to start debugging joomla html  these other answers will probably lead you to the answer  however one thing i noticed as a minor problem is some plugins set up error reporting on there own and that can override joomla s error reporting  so another way to fix this is to disable extensions one at a time until the site loads  plugins being the main offender   manually check other pages  does it load  if it does its a module or component only loaded on the front page  helping you isolate it  also updating your extensions is a good idea too  if it worked before perhaps your environment was php 5 2 and when you moved to 5 3 or 5 4 there was a major error being through by the differences   typically an update to an extension can fix that  as long as its actively maintained  though in some cases it could be your template

2014-04-25T09:33:43.140	315	cms^&^performance^&^cache^&^configuration	difference between standard cache options	joomla  have a 3 different way for caching     conservative caching   in global configuration   progressive caching   in global configuration  plugin  system   cache    i have the following questions    what are the differences  when do i use which option  should i enable the cache plugin when i already turned on the option in the configuration  what proper way to configure default cache system   	 difference between caching         conservative caching is the standard type of caching  here s how it works   a visitor visits a page on your website    joomla checks if there is a non expired version of that page in its cache directory  if the cached page exists  and it s not expired   then joomla will serve it to the visitor  otherwise  a cached version of the page is created  and that cached version will be served to the visitor  and to every other consequent visitor  as long as it s  by  it  we mean the page  not expired    the above scenario is typical and is how most developers implement caching   progressive caching works the following way    a visitor visits a page on your website  joomla checks if a cached version of that page exists for that visitor and it s not yet expired  if that cached page exists  then it ll be served to the visitor  otherwise  joomla will create the cached page for that specific visitor and then will serve it to him  if another visitor  who has never been on that page  visits that page  then joomla will not serve the cached page of the previous visitor  instead  it will create a cached version of that page specifically for that user  and then serves it to him    as you can see  progressive caching only offers a performance improvement   if the same visitor visits the same page within the lifetime of the cached version of the page   in most scenarios  progressive caching results in a huge performance hit that is far worse than disabling cache  simply because for nearly every visit  joomla has to process the request  create the cached version of the page  and then serve the page to the visitor  instead of just processing the request and serving the page in the scenario where cache is disabled    oh  and don t forget about all the cache files generated by joomla   you can only imagine how many of these files you will have in your cache folder if you have a high traffic news website  that has many pages     now you might wonder  under which circumstances is progressive caching useful  well  imagine that you have a video website  similar to youtube   you want to show each visitor customized pages based on his location and or browser settings and or plugins installed  so  for every page that the visitors loads  you use this information to generate a customized version of that page and you cache it  if the visitor visits that same page again  then joomla doesn t need to redo the work to generate the customized page   of course  there are many scenarios under which progressive caching is really useful  but in our opinion  progressive caching should only be considered if the website receives many visitors and if those visitors are mostly repeat visitors  using it in other cases will cause a significant hit on the website s performance   ref  read joomla caching in depth  conservative is recommended  cache plugin provide complete page cache when enabled    in addition to shyam s answer     in global configuration    cache       conservative caching is a cache generated for each view of a component   module progressive caching is a cache generated for each view of a component   module on an individual per user basis   this is an extension level cache of views  it must be implemented by the extension developer to have any effect   note  logged in users will never see cached content via these means   you can override individual module caching if  conservative caching  is enabled by disabling caching in the module s advanced options  you cannot override module caching on a per module basis if  progressive caching  is set   the system   cache plugin generates page caches of each whole page in  cache    for most scenarios  enabling the system   cache plugin is sufficient  if you only want to cache particular modules   components  which have caching implemented   disable the plugin and enable conservative caching in the global configuration  you can then set exceptions by disabling caching in a module s advanced options   note that any caching is a balance between time and space   full page caching will reduce db load and hence page load times  but will increase disk space usage   you can find further analysis and benchmarks of the caching system here   as well as the joomla cache docs for admins and this excellent article detailing the various options and applicable caveats

2014-04-25T19:46:00.823	347	recommended-practices^&^packaging	why does a joomla distribution still contain index html in each folder 	there has been an pr to remove the index html files  but it was never applied  why is that  	the reason for a index html in each folder is to protect it for disclose information on mis configured hosting environment   if this is a real problem and should the cms consider that is another question   i feel like this is an  edge case  scenario  a large portion of joomla users would be secure and safe without these files  but some people run joomla on a mis configured host  and some on a misconfigured host that won t let them reconfigure  which would display directory contents if the directory was requested  this file prevents that   on a personal level  if you don t need the files  it is unnecessary bloat in the cms and you can remove them   at the cms level  i think that it solves a problem that can have major security issues with relatively minor bloat   the files are usually empty or contain a tiny line of html    i can t speak to the exact reason that the pr was not accepted  since i don t even have that power  much less chat with the people that do   i think that the relative benefit to the community outweighs the bloat     that being said there is an alternate method that i have heard mentioned at a few joomla events about moving the majority of the files  up a level   the idea is to get all the files above the public html directory so that the files could not be accessed directly  you would only want the index php file   htaccess file  and the images and media folders web accessible  to keep your css  js  and images accessible    at this point  you rely less on a base server configuration and can more guarantee that the files won t be accessed inappropriately  this would have its own configuration issues  since now we need to access files above our  root     all in all  i m not sure that there is a more fool proof plan to keep people secure without lots of issues than using index html files  so if i was releasing a platform generally  i would stick to index html files

2014-04-28T15:32:18.020	419	joomla-3.x	is there a way to promote articles between environments 	is there an easy way to move articles between joomla installations  for example in a development staging production environment  i have the same 20 articles in each    if i make a change to all 20 articles in development  does joomla have a way of promoting those changes to staging  without physically copying those articles by hand   also  if i add or remove an article in one  does joomla have a way to add or remove it in the next environment  	i recommend to manage the articles in one place only  it will be hard to sync if there are changes in several places  but it is not impossible  just hard   if you manage in one place only  just drop the table data in the other places and insert again with the updated data   if you want to manage the articles in several places you can compare the modified date and copy the data of the last modified article to the other places  if articles were inserted in one place only  just insert this article to the other places  if articles were inserted in several places  copy the data of all these articles  drop them from database  and insert again in all database to keep the same id in all databases  this is just a idea about what you will need to do  so  i recommend to manage the articles in one place only   the more important here is to keep the same id to the articles between databases   look for extensions on the jed  both j2xml and sp transfer claim to have this functionaity

2014-04-30T16:53:04.737	498	cms^&^update	recommended extension   tool to check for core file modifications 	when updating joomla sites to the latest version i always have a minor panic in case the site i m upgrading  built in the past by some rogue developer  i e  me  6 years ago   happens to feature changes   hacks   to core joomla files   in an ideal world i could avoid this potential coronary by having an extension or tool that    knows all the core joomla files included in each version of joomla compares each file on my joomla install to the master joomla source files on github or wherever  even something like an md5 hash comparison  if they differ  kick off a diff tool to find the differences and flag them for review if they re the same  great stuff  no action required generate a report at the end detailing the results of the above process   i ve found this extension which does most of the above  but it hasn t been updated since j2 5 7 or at all for j3 x   so that s out   at my company we use myjoomla to conduct full joomla site  audits   a long checklist of best practice guidelines and fixes for joomla sites  every once in a while  part of which is a  core files integrity check   however this service has a monthly subscription fee and all i really want to check is whether any files have been hacked before making an upgrade   does anyone know of any other solutions  aside from  don t hack core files    until quite recently there was sometimes no other way to perform certain tasks without a boatload of additional  often unpaid  work  	i can t imagine a better tool than git   this is a great tool for tracking the changes that you make to code  if you are making any   is the system used by joomla for contributing code  which is an awesome thing to do   and this is its purpose   the workflow is pretty simple and should allow you to be pretty worry free    back up your joomla website  which you were doing before anyway  right   set up the backup copy locally  run git init on the root folder of the local copy  then run git add   all and git commit   this takes a snapshot of the code as it is now  grab the patch that matches your current joomla version  install that patch over your local copy  run git diff and you will see a list of all differences in files between what you have running and the core files      i recognize that this is a pretty  developery  answer and that not everyone wants to use git in the command line  if you use a git gui  such as github s client   you can skip the last step  since the gui will typically show you the diff automatically   ultimately i recommend this method since it both teaches you a skill that will help if you code and contribute to joomla and it keeps all of the checking locally  so you don t have to worry about shipping your code to another website or service   this is an extension of ffrewin s answer  akeeba also produce a free tool called sitediff  it allows you to compare 2 sites that have been backed up with akeebabackup  there is a free version of that too     to get this to work  you would have to have 2 backups  one backup would be of your site  let s say it was version 2 5 19    for the other backup  you would need to install a fresh copy of joomla 2 5 19 and then make a backup of that installation  next compare the two backups using the sitediff tool   a problem with this method is that you will have more files in your site backup than your fresh installation  the extra files will appear as differences possibly making it difficult to discern core changes from the rest of the  noise

2014-04-30T22:18:06.380	512	articles	implementing sticky articles	i d like to implement something similar to  sticky  articles in a forum  where one or two of these appear at the top  followed by blog content  and i want these  sticky  articles to be editable by a moderator in the front end   one way of simulating a single  sticky  article is to place the content in the category description  but  this only works for one article  and it not editable in the front end   i m willing to think laterally   perhaps i m thinking about it all wrong   this could possibly be done as a separate blog category that is displayed below the main articles  in a module    and where the blog items themselves are managed under a separate menu item  	the simplest method that i can think is to use the  featured  option on the articles  mark any article that you want  sticky  as  featured  in the article manager   then on the menu item for the blog layout  switch to the  blog layout  and look for  article order   select  featured articles order  to put the featured articles first   the bad side of this method is that it uses  ordering  as the secondary metric instead of date  so the articles will put the featured first and then sort them by the ordering that you set in the article manager  not necessarily newest first   this allows you to order the sticky articles though  so that is nice    i believe that new articles will default to the top order spot  so it should be roughly in date order  but there could be some quirks to that      pw  the secondary ordering is the feature order  not the article order  hence that s problem  unless i modify core code to add a third ordering   i ve created joomla tracker item  33685 and included a patch  now all we need to do is get it tested and accepted     matt thomas recently described his method  which i also favour  for creating sticky articles in joomla 3 x   http   betweenbrain com notes 71 sticky articles in joomla 3  in essence all you need to do is order articles by created date and set the creation date on your  sticky  article to something far in the future

2014-05-02T13:17:27.767	547	templates^&^fonts	workflow for developing   adjusting templates	usually i only adjust existing free templates and change colors and fonts  the question is  when i already have my joomla page online  what is the easiest way to make changes to the template css   currently  i m using the chrome development tools to find and adjust specific styles for a preview  if i like it  i adjust the css file of the template directly in the online editor in the administration area   when i first started and i didn t had any content  i used a local webserver with joomla which had the advantage  that i could use a proper ide for writing css and php code  since i already have some content now  i would like to see how the changes i make look with the content i have   i know that this is a basic question  but is there a preferred workflow when someone wants to adjust the design of an existing site  	you ve a few options here  depending on whether your focus is ease of use  automation or cost    do exactly what you did before with your local install  but once installed  change the local joomla installation to use your live  remote mysql database in configuration php   if your host supports remote access  be careful though   any db changes will roll over into live    use a component like extplorer and edit the template files directly in the browser  with another tab open displaying the site  still using chrome s dev tools  extplorer features code colouring and is great for making small changes quickly  use a version control system to push out changes   for example  develop your template in a local joomla install using your chosen ide  with the template in a repository  when done  commit changes to your live site  use a post commit hook to checkout those changes as a working version  whilst more complicated to set up  it does mean you can always rollback to old template versions if you make a mistake  add in remote mysql to ensure data consistency across local and live  pay for a proper template   template framework   at my company we use yootheme templates  this template framework has a feature called  customizr   which is basically a 2 pane window featuring hundreds of css variables  well  less variables  on the left and a live preview on the right  these variables control near enough every element of the template  from gutter padding to menu item text shadow  and everything in between  changes are applied instantly in the preview and multiple  styles  can be defined so you can play with different variable configurations  this all said  i m sure other template frameworks have very similar features    nb  i have no affliation with extplorer nor yootheme other than as a user   clone the livesite with akeeba  install it locally  then adjust as required  when you re finished ssh   ftp your changed files back to the live site   there are a whole host of good reasons why it s imprudent to  tweak  on a live site   if it s just css changes you are making you may as well continue previewing them in chrome development tools and using an online development environment such as cloud9 or shiftedit you can connect directly to your server via ftp and make tweaks to the live site using a proper ide similar to how you did when it was hosted locally   i wouldn t however recommend this for any bigger changes which could break your site  i learned the hard way a few years ago   for these i recommend setting up a local server  or a free vm from koding com    cloning the site with akeeba and using git  to push changes to your live site once they have been tested    if you don t want your code to be public on github one good alternative is bitbucket    method 1  one method i ve used is to add my own css file into the template index php file   this can be wrapped to only add it if you are the user   a way of extending this is to write a simple plugin that adds a css file if you are the user   i ve used this to make changes to the default admin template  to avoid making changes directly in the template that might be replaced by the next update   something like     class plgsystembb extends jplugin       public function onbeforecompilehead          if  jfactory  getuser    username     my login name goes here                 jfactory  getdocument    addstylesheet   templates protostar css test css               if  jfactory  getapplication    isadmin             return                jfactory  getdocument    addstylesheet   templates isis css admin extra css          method 2  to preview template changes  you can duplicate the template  and make changes in the duplicate  to view those changes  append   template test  to the url  which overrides the template  replace  test  with whatever name you have decided to use for the duplicate   note that you need to duplicate the whole template  and not just a style  both styles and templates can be duplicated in the admin gui   i don t believe it s possible to override a style in the url   pw  i just found out that in j3  you can override a style in the url  see method 3      method 3  similar to method 2 but with styles   use a  test  style and modify the main template to include the test stylesheet   to override a style in the url  add  templatestyle   where  is the template identifier  i e  numerical

2014-05-07T11:55:06.233	662	joomla-2.5^&^jroute	how to get itemid by url and pass it to jroute	i have a menu item for a specific view in a custom component  attached to this menu item i have another template style selected  not the standard template  accessing the view via the menu works well  as it s attaching to the url the itemid    now i want to link  using jroute  a view with another one  however jroute is not generating the desired url   echo jroute     index php option com example view reporting      index php option com example view reporting  jroute will not append the itemid to the url  causing the selected template style for the menu item not to work   is there a way to  calculate  the itemid  apart from doing a query in the table jos menu on the column link   and to attach it to jroute  	the output from jroute will depend on what you feed it    jroute     index php option com content view article id 10       might return something else than  jroute     index php option com content view article id 10 catid 5       in fact if you have a menu item category blog listing for catid 5  the latter might give you the menu url  i have not tested this exact url   try with different get parameters to get different results  sometimes very wrong  like  fedik said   the key here is to set up your components router php file  which should be found in the root folder of your component on the front end  with logic that will search for and select the appropriate menu item  i would love to see this automatically happen  but as far as i know this isn t the case   it would probably be best to work this block of code in to some type of helper function that can be used to automatically find the best fit menu item for the content   here is the code that i have used in several of my custom components to get the best fit menu item      i use this first empty array to avoid having unset properties in my query  base array   array  itemid        option        view

job done  if the current menu item is the best match  it will always stick with that   otherwise it should find the best match based on component name    view name    layout name    id value  the further to the right it matches  the better i deem the match   here is a technique i used  cannot remember where i found it     app   jfactory  getapplication      menu    app  getmenu     menuitem    menu  getitems   link    index php option com example view reporting   true    echo jroute     index php itemid    menuitem  id     this has worked wonders for me

2014-05-07T20:59:12.110	676	development^&^extensions^&^security	how to develop a safe extension 	before i m going to write my first extension  i would like to understand how to design it as invulnerable as possible   is there a set of rules to write safe joomla extension   i can imagine only sql injection as possible threat so i know that form input can be never inserted directly to sql command  as is    what are other vectors of attack i should be aware of when writing custom module or plugin  	one main thing which you have pointed out is sql injection  this is one thing which a few people i ve seen seem to miss completely and start developing using non joomla coding standards and start writing sql queires using mysql   commands   second thing which i kind of mentioned in the first point  which is always stick to joomla coding standards  the only time you shouldn t is when joomla does not provide an alternative    thirdly  if you re extension creates a folder or file  then ensure you give them the correct permissions and do not start making folder chmod 777  this is the exact reason why k2 which is one of the most popular extensions out there was considered vulnerable and removed from jed temporarily   always use tokens with forms  this will ensure that no unauthorized attacks from other sites can be executed  for more information regarding this  have a look at the following   http   docs joomla org how to add csrf anti spoofing to forms  if you re unsure of something having already run some tests  try popping along to the code review stackexchange as there might be someone willing to check over your code for you   one thing you can do is have a look at the vulnerable extensions list to see the extensions that have temporarily  until fixed  been removed from the joomla extensions directory due to not being safe   hope this gives you a little insight and good luck with your first extension  it is mostly safe for most extensions  however be very cautious on anything that may need to save edit files  improper filtering or validation can create an entry point   as long as you use jdatabase s api correctly you should be secure from sql injection as well  you can look at com content or plg system loadpositon in a joomla install to help figure out some of the finer points of various joomla api s  since documentation is a bit hard to follow    also using the api s if they fail and some sort of vulnerability is used  the fix would probably end up being a core update  if its jdatabase  i can imagine a joomla release within the hour if its discovery  d   rather then an update to your extension   this is one major flaw of open source is that anyone intending to do harm has all the information needed to do so  if it is a closed extension  not publicly available  chances are there will never be a problem   lastly the more simple the extension is  less code  the more likely it is that it will be  invulnerable   as an extension grows there are many more places a slight mistake can happen to create an entry point   following the official documentation  here are some steps on the topic secure coding guidelines     validate any data you get from the request  post  get  etc    don t trust the user and be as strict as possible  if you expect an integer   don t allow a string to be accepted  file uploads   avoid  whenever possible  accepting file on public web pages  if you need to validate the file meta information and do all possible checks  constructing sql queries   understand how sql injections work but also how you handle database errors  the more errors you display  the more information you give about your database structure  secure forms by using a token

2014-05-08T21:20:27.013	707	cms^&^joomla-3.x^&^administrator	pagination of lists at backend   how to add custom list size 	how can i add custom value to site settings   default list limit in joomla 3 x   i can see dropdown menu with values 5  10  15  20  25  30  50  100 there   i would like to add item 500    can be the choice unlimited added implemented easily  too  	the backend setting doesn t show the  all  option that is presented when a list limit item is shown in paginated view but it does exist  so  you shouldn t need an  unlimited  option in the configuration as it s added to the limit list when the pagination object is created   e g  you can see the  all  option at the bottom of this selector     i m not aware of a direct way  in the past we ve hacked the core but we don t recommend that due the issues this causes when you apply updates down track  i m guessing you want a persistent modification that won t be over written by any joomla updates that will be released in the future   this is just speculation  but  you will probably need to write a system content plugin to modify joomla s behaviour in two places first the com config form for the joomla application   application xml    you will need to add the extra value s  you want to the form element list limit   i d probably start by trying the onbeforerender or oncontentprepareform triggers   then  i imagine you will need to modify the jpagination object so that it also shows your additional value s   as pagination objects are used in manager view  at least in the backend  i m not sure which event you would want to capture  i d investigate onafterinitialise   onafterroute   onbeforerender   oncontentprepare and oncontentbeforedisplay    those first three triggers are very early on in the apps life  but i m not sure how early late you can make the changes you need

2014-05-06T12:41:08.967	725	joomla-2.5^&^k2	how do deal with multiple article authors  with without k2 	i have got in our company joomla publication software to care about   we are using joomla to publish technical magazine articles  mostly one article have 2 3 authors  in the past the admins solved this multiplicity with placing all author names in the beginning of article text  but this is not optimal for search article by authors  where the articles are showing only by the author which is assigned in the article author column   i have looked for some module which allow us the multiple author functionality  but without success   and i m not a joomla expert to build my own extension  i got an idea how do this anyway   do you know some extension that can do some  relations    it means that will create table where will be stored id from author with id from article  for example the drupal cms has relation module to achieve this  from this database table i can do the operations we needed to show in frontend  my idea is described on this image    we are using the k2 extension  but here in the  extra fields  cck we cannot add the extra field with authors   we are looking for solution with or withouth k2 extension   i hope that some extension will be suitable to our problem  we don have capacity to hardcode this feature  	if the main concern is front end search then you could just switch to using tags for displaying the authors  names   then you can add author information to the tag for each author and when you clicked the tag you d get the author information plus the list of all items created by that author  you could also make a menu link for each author if you wanted to have some more control over the urls and layouts   as a practical matter that really depends on how many authors you re talking about and how much you want to automate   you could also make a contact record for each author and tag that  doing that would let you have more fields than just what you get in the tag description plus have the  contact me  form if you wanted    then there are some display selected tags modules around that would let you display the list of articles with that author tag  there is one from last year s summer of code that is good for that but it s also very easy to make your own module   you could make a plugins to manage some parts of this also   i have done the same thing for research journal last year in joomla 2 5  i needed to use community builder for the author profiles  look here for example  http   www bwpat de ausgabe 25 schwarz bretschneider  then i used the extension fieldsattach to add a new field for the author ids  and some more fields   in this field the author ids in the correct order are manually written  i e  1345 2651  i copied the module article author and changed to code to get multiple authors  so now on each article page the authors are shown automatically in the right column   and in the template overrides i could also get the author information from the cb user table  to show the author names and institutions just after the heading   edit  for showing the articles in the cb user profile   author   i added a cb query field where i would look up the article id in the fieldsattach value table      select fa articleid fa value con title from xxxx fieldsattach values   as fa left join   xxxx content as con  on  con  id   fa  articleid     where fa  fieldsid    14  and fa  value like    user id      and in the row field i would add    li  a href  index php option com content view article id  column articleid    column title   a   li

2014-05-08T15:48:45.190	728	cms^&^component^&^development	how does the form submission with views   tasks actually work 	hi i have a question about joomla forms  i want to understand how joomla works internally  especially i m interested in com installer component to know how it s working  and i found a form in default php file in com installer views install tmpl folder    in this file there are custom buttons for submitting a form  and i m interested in how the buttons are actually trigger the installation of components  modules or other things itself  in the form body i see some hidden values like   input type  hidden  name  task  value  install install       so this hidden value probably trigger a installation by calling a install controller and install method of that controller    but the question is how joomla does this  where is the code redirecting the url from view install to task install install  in other words how joomla knows that the value form the hidden input should go to the url  	 riccardozorn is correct at the base level  there are two hidden form fields that are commonly set  option and task   option  the component name such as com example directs the page to load that component   task  a controller function or a controller and a function to call  if it has a     in it then the part before that specifies a controller to load and then call the function with the name of the part after the period  if there is no period  then it will just run the function in the default controller  usually controller php in the base folder of the component     you also specifically ask about the toolbar buttons  this involves a little bit of javascript that automatically is loaded by joomla to power the buttons   when the button is clicked  it should trigger joomla submitbutton     this function takes a value that is the task to set based on the button clicked  so if you click the save button  this will commonly set the task to import save    i don t think that button actually exists in this component  but many others will have that    the submitbutton function by default just pushes that to another function submitform   this function will then shift that task into the appropriate hidden field  finally this submits the form   so even though those toolbar buttons are not submit buttons  or even in the form tag usually  they will still update the hidden value of task and submit the form using javascript   you can find the core javascript functions here  media system js core uncompressed js  
2014-05-09T17:10:24.753	731	development^&^extensions^&^templates^&^twitter-bootstrap-2^&^twitter-bootstrap-3	which bootstrap version should be used v2 3 or v3 in new extensions	as an extension developer  i am still confused which bootstrap version to be used in my upcoming extension     in many discussion i found that joomla 3 x will not utilize bootstrap 3 0  most of template providers uses bootstrap v3 many extensions also using bootstrap v3   what to opt   	joomla 3 x ships with the files for bootstrap 2  and due to backward compatibility this is not likely to change in joomla 3 x series   it s important to know that bootstrap consists of two main areas    the css files the javascript framework   css  joomla has those files included both as source less files and compiled css files  joomla itself doesn t load any bootstrap css files  that s up to the template to decide if it wants to use those files or ship with own css files   in the backend  the active template usually is  isis   which heavily uses the bootstrap 2 files  thus it makes sense to make use of bootstrap 2 styling in your extension backend  especially since there aren t many alternative administration templates anyway  in frontend however it s a completely different topic  you have no clue what template the user will use and on which framework that one will be based  personally i settle on using bootstrap 2 styling here as well for the sole reason that the core output uses those as well  thus chances are high that a template will support those classes  otherwise it provides an override for the output  if it uses overrides for core  your extension likely will need an override as well anyway   you can of course add support for bootstrap 3 as well  but that means to double your work  i would however never only provide bootstrap 3 layouts without an option to load bootstrap 2 ones   javascript  joomla has methods to load bootstrap javascript code  like for tooltips or tabs  this code can and should be used by extensions  just make sure to load them in your layouts so they are overridable by templates if needed

name    plg form settings    field  name       content      div class  control group          content      div class  control label              content     field  label       content       div         content      div class  controls              content     field  input       content       div     content       div      as you can see it worked assuming that  field  name is public  however in 2 5 it is protected  it is in 3 as well which baffles me  its never not worked in any version of 3    i have checked the differences between jformfield in 2 5 and 3 and there are massive differences  though one way or another i need to access the  field  name property  i do see i can do  field    get  name   for read only access   i could ignore the functionality of jformfield but that seems a bit counter productive to add backwards compatibility   in joomla 3 there is a function called   set  name  value  however it is not in joomla 2 5  is there any  simple  way to override a field name  or other property  in joomla 2 5  	i have been working hard on this and come up with a solution  its the  proper  way to do it that other modules do but are hidden behind multiple layers of objects  so a bit hard to figure out    first i thought that the problem was in jformfield but it really was not  it has no need to access those properties since they only  parse  the fields were not made to give any direct control   so here is a bit of the other code i have   if  form  loadfile  path   fields xml              fieldset    form  getfieldset              sql stuff here to get  result          result    db  loadobject            if isset  result  params                 moduleparams   json decode  result  params            else               moduleparams   new stdclass                    foreach  fieldset as  index   field                field  name    plg form settings    field  name                   content      div class  control group                      content      div class  control label                          content     field  label                   content       div                     content      div class  controls                          content     field  input                   content       div                 content       div                      this loops each field in the fieldset and returns an instance of jformfield a more or less read only class  what should be done is any edits you want to do is done via jform itself   if  form  loadfile  path   fields xml          fieldset    form  getfieldset          sql stuff here to get  result      result    db  loadobject        if isset  result  params             moduleparams   json decode  result  params        else           moduleparams   new stdclass             dataarray   array          split the loop into 2  this way the data can be bound     foreach  fieldset as  index   field           if  id  0  isset  moduleparams    index                  dataarray  index     moduleparams    index                         bind and reset to ensure it worked      form  bind  dataarray        fieldset    form  getfieldset        foreach  fieldset as  index   field            output     div class  control group                  output      div class  control label                      output     field  label               output       div                 output      div class  controls                      output     field  input               output       div             output       div             content     output            as you can see i use 2 loops  one is just to match a parameter to a field  i could probably improve it by looping the actual  moduleparams object   while the other is the same as the one i had before  in between i bind the data to form and  reset  the fieldset variable  not sure if its needed but it does not hurt in the debugging process  this however will only correctly change the  field  value as you are binding a forms value  so the other variables are still protected   so i came up with a solution for name  which this question was mainly about  jform is fairly strict on the name as it uses that as a basis for its interaction with other objects  so its best not to touch it while jform is parsing the form  but after   the function i have shown is part of a  helper  so i moved this outside of it and into the plugin itself  since i am creating an html string i can use regex to find replace    regex         name                     call helper to get  content  content     input type  text  name  cc field        example of part of output from helper  content   preg replace  regex  name   cc settings  1      content     this should allow you to change the name as well  outside of issues that can be cause by editing it while the jform object is parsing the fields

2014-06-01T17:05:15.743	1090	user-groups	filtering the usergroups loaded in com config	following my previous post   trying to make the load of config component lighter  since  the majority of my usergroups are children of the registered usergroup and inherit the same permissions  i don t need them to get loaded in com config    as a workaround  i am looking for a way to filter them out  by hacking the core code  i tried with a where in the getusergroups   function in    administrator components com config models fields filters php   as well in     administrator components com config model fields filters php      the function became like    protected function getusergroups                    get a database object           db   jfactory  getdbo               get the user groups from the database           query    db  getquery true            query  select  a id as value  a title as text  count distinct b id  as level             query  from     usergroups as a             query  join  left       usergroups as b on a lft   b lft and a rgt   b rgt             query  where  a parent id    2             query  group  a id  a title  a lft             query  order  a lft asc             db  setquery  query            options    db  loadobjectlist            return  options          but these changes seem to have no effect in the groups loading of the com config  i did the same change in   libraries joomla form fields rules php   and this filters out those groups  but i am afraid that this might act globally in what u groups joomla will see  affecting some of the components that i need to see those u groups   at first  why the hack on the com config getusergroups   function has no effect   what should i do in order to achieve my filtering there    secondly  i am right to consider that my second modification will hide those u groups from everywhere in joomla    	i ended up by hacking the rules php inside       libraries joomla form fields rules php   as it is documented inside the file  this is a form class for assigning permissions to groups for a given asset    the getusergroups   in the com config seems to do nothing for permissions groups load  but it is used for the groups in the filters section  obviously    checking in com users  i can still see my extra usergroups and probably i will still have the required access for my other needs   so in my case  this small core hack will keep me going  till joomla comes out with a better solution  of course it is not maintainable an i should manually re do this after any updates

2014-06-02T03:38:35.400	1093	component^&^security	jomsocial or community builder 	i m going to make a small social network and i do not have any experience in this issue  which is better to use  jomsocial or community builder  which one is more secure  please give me your reasons   best regards  ata 	don t get me wrong  community builder comes in very handy as it integrates with other extensions and is rather flexible  however  it s an absolutely massive extension  this is due to the fact that it supports mambo and joomla 1 0 all the way through to 3 x  therefore there is simply a load of code sitting around  another drawback is that it wasn t written using mvc therefore things like template overrides  which are widely used  are impossible   having said that  community builder 2 0 has been completely re written so it might be worth waiting till it becomes available to download    i have never actually used jomsocial  so i m unable to comment on the features  however i do know that this extension uses mvc and will make life much easier for you   community builder my first touch with social extensions for joomla was with community builder  some years ago  on my early steps into the joomla world  at that time  i found it troublesome enough  as it needed a significant amount of configuration steps  since that time  i have never used it again  not because i didn t like it  but just because it never happened    jomsocial as for jomsocial  i have used it on joomla 1 5 and joomla 2 5 websites as per customer needs  as you can find in various posts in the web  it does indeed a pretty good job on letting you build rather fast  an adequate social network in joomla  out of the box   it has a significant amount of features and comes packaged with nice layouts  that will let you be up and running   comparison but comparing to community builder  it will reach rather soon a limit  regarding the configuration and extensibility options  particularly if you want to take your social network to the next level  furthermore  i have heard many users complain about the level of support  but i know that recently jomsocial has changed owner and i can t be sure about the current situation    integration regarding extensibility and integrations  both components are well known in the joomla community and there are dozens of plugins  templates and other extensions that integrate with both   mvc as lodder said  mvc is critical point when we are talking about joomla extensions these days  it just makes coder s life much more flexible and the maintenance is a lot more  easier  if the new cb is going to be released using mvc  then this is surely a very huge advantage  considering that in the long run  it looks like a more solid and extensible extension   migration one other thing  that you might want to consider  is the option to migrate from one component to the other  on this topic  i have heard about a jomsocial tool  that will let you migrate a community builder social network to jomsocial  while there is not such a tool for the other way so far   plan   research i would suggest to make a plan of what you want your social network do and write down the features and functionality you are going to need  then compare the features of the 2 extensions and also try extensively their demos and search on their forums about posts related to your desired features  issues etc   conclusion finally  it all comes to what you want your social network do  if you need a quick and simple social network without much work  then jomsocial looks like your choice  if you envision a much more complicated social network  then better consider cb

3 0 1 - 3 1 5 - 3 2 0  since then i ve been able to upgrade normally  i m running 3 2 2 and planning to upgrade to 3 3 shortly   for upgrades from 2 5 to 3 3  i have had more luck doing a manual upgrade as well   for the versions  i will go up to 2 5 20  3 0 3  3 1 6  3 2 4  3 3 0   this is the full process    download all those versions and unzip on local machine  here is a good resource  http   www whitefirdesign com resources joomla release archive html   backup using akeeba make clone site in subfolder using akeeba kickstart  make use new database  in backend of website  uninstall  problem  extensions  see bottom of post  in ftp  upload all files from a new joomla version except the  installation  folder  in backend of website  go to extensions  extensions manager  database  and hit fix then go to extensions  extensions manager  discover  hit discover and install for anything it finds go to acl manager  if you don t have  i highly suggest  and fix any acl problems it finds   http   aclmanager net repeat process with next version of joomla     after you get up to newest version    reinstall  problem  extensions backup new version test site for problems move original site into subfolder move new site into root to go live   this whole process takes a long time because of the upload time for full versions  but it saves headaches   for problem extensions  these are just ones that have caused issues during upgrades for me   my hypothesis is that the install package actually has different versions for j2 5 vs j3 3 so it gets confused when you upgrade   if anyone has found others  please let me know    nonumbers extensions  nn manager  cache cleaner  adv module manager  modules anywhere  etc    these extensions can cause problems if not using the most recent release    rsform  jw allvideos rokbox rsform  social bookmarks xmap   
2014-06-07T00:16:43.880	1159	joomla-3.x^&^language	how to setup a new multi language website 	one of my old clients want to turn to joomla instead of a static html5 css3 responsive multi languages website  i m a newbie to joomla  and my biggest challenge is how to make a multi languages joomla website that contains rtl and ltr languages  so i started with testing the  language switcher module  i ve enabled the  system plugin  language filter  and i ve configured a position to the module  but it doesn t work  when i hover over the box and click on it  nothing appears  so the question is  how can i make it working      edit    the main problem is  the language switcher menu doesn t show any language code in it s list  it doesn t dropdown at all    	the recent versions of joomla provide build in multi language capabalities   however  setting up a multi language  requires a few more steps than just enabling the plugin and the language switcher module    briefly the steps are as below    install the language packs  from the extension manager    install languages    this will translate system labels like read more etc  define content languages   these are the languages that will be assigned to the content elements  articles  menus  modules etc   enable   configure system   language filter plugin  create the languages category structure       you need to create a root category for each language  e g english  french and assign the content language you created earlier on each one  then you can create the subcategories for each language  and remember to create a category languages all  for content that will be used for all the languages  create your main articles and assign them to the languages  create the menus and the menu items for each language  one menu for each language   you will need to have also an all  languages  homepage menu item and a home menu item for each language and do all the menu items associations    follow the same approach for any modules  create the corresponding modules for each language  publish the language switcher module    a more detailed tutorial can be found here  also  you may want to consider some 3rd party extensions that provide extra flexibility or a different approach   update for your specific issue with the languages module   make sure you have created the home menu items and their language associations for each language  try to follow the steps as described in the tutorials   the native multi language system of joomla is ok if you have a few articles and modules   if you have a lot of articles  modules  it s not simple to handle because everything is in duplicate  imagine if you have 500 articles  you will need 500 articles in english  500 in french  etc   so  i suggest to use a module like this one    http   www faboba com en composants falang html  with this module  you have only one article and inside this article you manage the different translations  same thing for module like menu

2014-06-11T12:26:12.940	2236	joomla-3.3.x^&^templates^&^css	creating new template in 3 3	i m creating my 1st new template   very beginner   i ve a static html5 and css3 website that i created myself from scratch and converting this to a joomla 3 3 template   i ve read some tutorials about how to make a basic template and so on but i really don t have time to put my hand on everything  so i need a fast solution that i can just use all my css styling and ignore anything comes from joomla   i ve tried to put some styled  div  tags into my index or as a module under  custom html  but there are some css styles that overriding my css rules so i just want to get rid of everything from joomla and keep my new template clean   i ve this inside my index php   doc   jfactory  getdocument     doc  addstylesheet  this  baseurl     media jui css bootstrap min css     doc  addstylesheet  this  baseurl     media jui css bootstrap responsive css     doc  addstylesheet  templates      this  template     css style css     doc  addscript   templates      this  template     js main js    text javascript      but i think the main style that overrides mine come from this line   jdoc include type  head       which i dunno what it brings  	unfortunately joomla doesn t work like this  to make a joomla template  you have to have some dynamic elements such as the jdoc tag that imports the component and so forth    jdoc include type  head     is also a requirement and a very handy one at that  basically  it gets all the script  link and anything else that is supposed to be injected into the  head  from an extension  and injects it in there for you  for example  lets say you has a module that required graph js  to import this  you would use something like this   jhtml     script   juri  root      modules my module js graph js      now  jdoc include type  head     gets the code above and injects it into the  head  for you so that you don t have to manually do it  therefore  keep it there ad do not remove it  i will also be required for some core scripts that get shipped with joomla   if you wish to use modules in your site  you can t simply add the html code to your index php and expect it to work properly and be dynamic  this is why we use    jdoc include type  modules  name  position 7       which imports the module and the html structure that coded with is  you can however add custom html to wrap around the module like so    div class  sidebar        div class  sidebar inner            jdoc include type  modules  name  position 7           div       div class  sidebar inner            jdoc include type  modules  name  position 8           div    div    it s not very complex and it also makes life so much simpler  joomla is not based on a static approach therefore you should stick to the way it works   the general rule when doing a template is to load your own css files after the  jdoc include type  head       that s important because this way you have the final say over css rules  however that also means that you don t use  doc  addstylesheet   in your template  instead you just write it as plain html into your head after the jdoc statement   there is one reason to still use the api to add javascript or css files within your template  that is if you load assets which may also be loaded by extensions  then joomla will take care that it s only loaded once  while otherwise you may have loaded it twice   so it would maybe make sense to load the bootstrap file using the api  but your own template style  style css  and javascript  main js  should be loaded hardcoded after the jdoc tag   on a sidenote  you can load the bootstrap css by using jhtmlbootstrap  loadcss     http   api joomla org cms 3 classes jhtmlbootstrap html method loadcss    this is perfectly fine when done within a template  but never use this call within an extension   however it may make more sense to work from the bootstrap less files and compile your own css file from it  then you can even mix and match the things you need and leverage the mixins and variables already provided by bootstrap

caused the entire permissions control to go blank    so does anyone know if what i am trying to do is possible within the com config component view   the reason i want to have this at the component level is because i m trying to achieve full cascading acl  where in the super admin can set acl to the component   the view   the record  which will allow me to hid sections of the component that are not relative to the current users access permissions    so if you know how this could be done using com config please let me know    d i ll be searching for a solution in the mean time  if i find it i ll post    happy joomla ng  	not sure if it s a typo but the access xml is missing the closing   access  tag   i never tried but i don t think you can have multiple permissions fields in the same config     the component section is used on the component level options  the category one is used by com categories for the single category permissions  the others may be used for single item permissions  like in case of com content you have an article section which is used to set the permissions for each article individually    if you need separate acl for each views  you need to create own acl rules and don t use the core ones  like com babelu exams level create

            and it uses easing js as well as i was included in the head   since joomla s index is in php so i ve included easing js as following       doc  addscript   templates      this  template     js easing js    text javascript      and i ve copied and pasted the function to main js and loaded it to my index php  but it didn t work   so i put the script inside the index php   it didn t work as well     i dunno how to make it work   i ve created the menu as a custom html module   so what should i do   	ok one thing with joomla is never use the   character for jquery without making sure it is not conflicting with mootools  joomla has gotten better but its best to just use jquery rather then   in my opinion  its far less stressful then the other ways   also i assume the html loads fine  just no javascript  here are some thoughts to help with that     function       switch this with  jquery document  ready function     they both do the same thing in the end  though  ready is easier to see as the  onload  function and makes it less confusing later to add more to it if need be  also as stated above replacing   with jquery can help with mootools compatibility  along with other js libraries in joomla    also use console log if there are no errors to track what is not happening  is the script not loading  try to include something like console log  loaded    right inside the initial function  this should tell you if it loaded the scripts  then add them to the bind events as well to see if the mouseenter events are not being called  if it all seems to load then you can split the chain of functions up and console log the output to see if it is what you would expect  however this is all based on at least some javascript know how  however to give a more clear answer i will need to see the html for the form as well   the rest below is my original post and assumes a normal menu module  did not see that it was custom until i got this far but i am going to leave it since it might help others   make sure the id in the menu module is set correctly  inspect the menu to ensure that all id s  classes are correct as well   if you need a root class then be careful with suffix  it makes you think that it adds a class but it actually adds whatever to the end of the current class  so a space tricks it into adding its own class  separate from the default  this is one problem i have seen on a few websites and custom js on the menu s  so when creating the menu module  make sure the to use     sdt menu

2014-06-15T14:05:20.387	2303	jdatabase^&^fix-my-code	selecting data from multiple jdatabase tables 	i am trying to select data from multiple jdatabase tables and use a if else statement with this     db   jfactory  getdbo     user   jfactory  getuser      query    db  getquery true    query  select  db  quotename  username            from  db  quotename     table1       table2       table3       table4            where  db  quotename  username             db  quote  user  username      db  setquery  query    result    db  loadresult     if  result    echo  hey you are already there      else   echo  sorry boss  you are out        how it should work     the above query should check whether the username of the current logged in user is present in any of the four tables      table1       table2       table3       table4   and should accordingly follow the if else statement  but      it only selects records from the first table     table1  and it ignores all other tables    i mean  if the username is already present in     table2       table3      table4  and not in the first table     table1    it still jumps to else statement which means it only checks for the username in the first table     any guesses on how to make it select records from all the four tables  	to check for a value in multiple tables that do not have a relationship you are going to need either to make multiple queries  1 for each table  or better make a union query  now  joomla has the union database methods  but those work only on joomla 3 3 and later   the concept of the query you are going to need for your case should be similar to this    query    select  username  from     table1  where  username     user  username union   select  username  from     table2  where  username     user  username  union   select  username  from     table3  where  username     user  username      make sure you will use the joomla methods to add quotes to your query  then check if there is result with the loadresult   method   for joomla 3 3 and later  and possibly soon for the latest j2 5 version  now  if you are on joomla 3 3  you can use the union methods like below    query    db  getquery true    query2    db  getquery true    query3    db  getquery true    query4    db  getquery true     query  select  db  quotename  username            from  db  quotename     table1            where  db  quotename  username             db  quote  user  username      query2  select  db  quotename  username             from  db  quotename     table2             where  db  quotename  username             db  quote  user  username      query3  select  db  quotename  username             from  db  quotename     table3             where  db  quotename  username             db  quote  user  username      query4  select  db  quotename  username             from  db  quotename     table4             where  db  quotename  username             db  quote  user  username      query  union  query2   union  query3   union  query4      union method allows you to chain the union queries     db  setquery  query    result    db  loadresult      hope this helps    it is possible that there might be some syntax parse errors  as i wrote this on here  let me know if you encounter any such problem so i can correct my answer   
2014-06-16T05:54:48.987	2305	security	what to do if my joomla website got hacked 	i have a joomla 2 5 website  yesterday i was not able to login administrator panel  i checked out users table  i was shocked when i saw that all the users  username field were   admin   and passwords were   268e27056a3e52cf3755d193cbeb0594    i generally do not use unfamous unreliable third party extensions    is anyone here who has encountered the same issue  if yes  can you tell me what the reason is and what the solution is  	what i recommend you do straight away is    create a new installation of joomla on a subdomain or localhost   create a super user account with a strong password copy the password hash from the    users table from your newly created account and replace the old one    i m not sure how the hashes and usernames were changed but it could be down a few reasons  always ensure you are running the latest version of joomla and the latest version of extensions  there are quite a few extensions out there that makes sites vulnerable to sql injections  i can t stress how important keeping things up to date is   you might want to start considering migrating to joomla 3 3 soon as possible  as this version provides one of the most secure password encryption methods  bcrypt    and as  brian has mentioned  updating your database password to something stronger is highly recommended  another good thing to take into consideration is also changing your database table prefixes  a lot of joomla sites use jos  which you can change to something a bit more unique using an extension such as admin tools which was mentioned in the other answer  this can be something very frustrating  sometimes a site can not stay updated for various reasons  though for the best help  please include the full version  like 2 5 9 or something  if you have already removed extensions as a possibility then an older version of joomla could be the reason    we have seen something similar on our sites before  was it on a shared server  this can happen even in a clean site on a shared server  if one account on the shared server gets hit  it could compromise the entire server  there is not much you can do about it either  nothing joomla has can prevent such an exploit and its one reason why shared hosts can be problematic  though this depends on the host  ones like siteground or hostgator are pretty good at keeping their infrastructure intact   so i would recommend doing a malware scan to see what it picks up  most likely if they hit your database like that then they have a lot of files injected  its best to restore from backup in this case and update  then malware scan   also look into admin tools by akeeba  it has some useful tools to secure your site   to keep you website always secured  you need a strict security policy    update joomla to the latest version use only themes from well known developers  no exceptions   and update to the latest version use only extensions from well known developers  no exceptions   and update to the latest version implement a security extension for joomla hardening  akeeba admin is a must  and it s free    please  check this security checklist   security checklist you have been hacked or defaced http   docs joomla org security checklist you have been hacked or defaced     a safe route for disaster relief      a  save the configuration php file and your images and personal files one by one   not the folder as it may contain unwanted files    b  wipe the entire folder where joomla  is installed   c  upload a new clean full package latest version of joomla 1 5 x or joomla 2 5 x  joomla 3 x  minus the install folder    d  reupload your configuration file   images    e  reupload or reinstall the latest versions of your extensions   templates  even better is to use original clean copies to ensure that the hacker defacer did not leave any shell script files in your site    f  to do this will take your site off line for around 15 minutes  to track down your hacked defaced html may take hours or even longer    today i have encountered same problem again  it is not joomla or its extensions  it is because i have set all the files and directories  chmod to 775  i have done it just to update joomla easier    after reading http   www itoctopus com the mass username password update hack in joomla   i have looked at the change dates of directories and investigate ones which have different values   i use winscp for ftp access  i have seen 5  php files with shortcut icon which i cannot open to view their contents    settings php e107 config php config php conf global php wp config php   and also in includes directory   config php configure php   i have deleted them and restore the web sites from backup  and i promise  i will not give write access for www data group except images directory

2014-06-17T12:34:11.203	2317	joomla-3.3.x^&^tags	unexpected parent tag association	i m using 3 3 0 and started playing with the tags   i ve noticed that all of the tags recently created have the joomla tag as their parent   when i edit the tag  the parent pull down menu is set to none  however if i unpublish the joomla tag  then the subsequent tags get unpublished as well  and cannot be published until i publish the joomla tag    is this expected behavior     some screen shots  components    tags  i ve unpublished the tag joomla which also unpublishes most of my other tags  oddly  not the baking  although that one was added at a different time than the others  leading me to believe that something has changed in the meantime    if i click on the status of scilab  it will not change   if i toggle the status of joomla  all  save for baking  follow suit     components    tags    scilab  no parent is set   here i can publish the tag  and it seems to persist until i toggle the joomla tag  joomla is still behaving like the parent     components    tags    baking  why baking isn t sharing the fate of all my other tags is beyond me       in response to answer by  ffrewin  here is a screenshot of my jos tags table   it looks as if there are problems with the lft rgt values   additionally  the path shows that joomla is the parent of all the tags  even though baking is not behaving as if it has a parent    	if there are not any other hacks on the code that affect the save functions of the component  then this issue makes me think that something can be messed up in the nested set model in the jos tags table    you will need to check your tags db table with a tool like phpmyadmin   to see about those values  and maybe if you need further advise  post here a screenshot of tags table columns for further investigation  for more info  check this post here that describe the nested set model concept   but in a brief  if all your tags are those i see in the screenshot  you should expect to see something similar to the screenshot i post here   what you should care more from my screenshot is the parent id  of course   the lft  rgt  level and path values   since you want all your tags be children of the root tag  meaning having no other tags as parent   then they should be all set to level 1 and parent id   1  for lft and rgt values  then you all your tags should have numbers with no larger difference than 1  between their left right values  while root should have the lft value set to 0 and the right set to the higher number of this calculation    total number of tags   2   1    generally there is not an easy way to deal with this for the com tags  if it happens that you just have only a few tags  then you could edit the lft rgt values by hand  of course after have calculate them   if you have an extended number of tags  then you would probably have to look to write a php script  that will calculate and set those values properly   hope this helps and will not be too much confusing   to be specific   follow these tasks   set root lft rgt 0 13  joomla lft rgt to 1 2 baking 3 4 and continue like this till your last tag travel which should be 11 12  also remove from the path the joomla and the slash part  but in any case   first take a backup of your db      update  the nested set model diagram

2014-06-17T17:23:35.833	2323	php^&^module	using caching for module or component independently	is it true that even if i enable module caching from module setting  module caching not works unless system cache plugin turned on    i want to use cache per module component from their settings not via code irrelevant of whether cache plugin or cache in global configuration enabled or not       	yes  module caching will only work if the module has this option enabled and if the caching option is selected in the global configuration  this is of course assuming the module has the caching parameter added to it which all core modules have    do bare in mind thought that the caching option in the global configuration is different to the caching that the system cache plugin does  the plugin will cache the whole page including module even if the module has the option disabled    the only problem with adding a caching field to the xml file of all 3rd party extensions is of course that it is considered a core hack so in my opinion you would be best off using an extension such as jotcache  hope this helps

2014-07-03T06:57:18.493	2489	administration	multiple website managment with joomla 	i hear from my cousin that joomla is an excellent cms   however  i have a question  as i d like to do something that i m not sure if he did or not     basically  i m planning on starting three different websites  under one web host   i know of a web host that supports this   the question i have it this  can i administer all three sites under one joomla instance   if so  is there a best practices for doing this  administration wise   update  i just saw this in the docs  http   docs joomla org multiple domains and web sites in a single joomla  installation that essentially explains how to do this   so now i guess my question is  is it a good idea to do this  or would it ultimately create more trouble than it s worth  	joomla multi sites is a long waited feature and a core capability to implement this is in my wish list  so far there were a few really good 3rd party extensions that handled this feature  which allow great flexibility and many different configuration scenarios   this is the first time i hear about the core ability to create a multi sites configuration with a single joomla installation  i have not tried what is described in this documentation and i have no idea about its advantages or disadvantages  although i think that with this method there will be no easy way to distinguish the 2 websites in the backend  and have them work as 2 independent sites   this is not necessarily a bad thing  if you will be the only one who will update the websites  i guess you will have to implement a logical content organization  categories  modules  menus  and familiarize yourself with the process of creating editing the right content for each website    in general  a multi sites scenario as described in that documentation can be ideal for 2 similar websites of 1 owner  since you will have to maintain only 1 installation  and it doesn t seem to hard to make it work   however  i can t visualize at this moment how far you will be able to go by implementing this approach and what possible disadvantages or restrictions you might come across    as said  joomla multi sites has been handled by 3rd party extensions since long time ago  you should define your actual requirements for your setup  then do a further research and have a look at the 3rd party extensions at jed   in order to find out more about current possibilities of a joomla multi sites scenario   so far  i have worked with jms multi sites and mighty sites   which are great and allow database tables sharing for many components across different domains   i am also curious to hear anyone else that have tried the core ability to setup multi sites with joomla though      if it s only 3 sites  and the content and extensions are different  i wouldn t mess with multi site stuff  just set all 3 up separately  and then use a tool like watchful li to monitor them and push updates to them from one dashboard  if you use akeeba pro you can even set up watchful to run backups for you  say  to an s3 account  and it will notify you if there are updates to your extensions   watchful li

2014-07-11T21:53:52.613	3570	joomla-3.3.x^&^articles^&^menu-item^&^gantry	menu items and item id	i ve set up a site using a rockettheme template  on the homepage there are several blog items  articles of the blog category   the homepage item id is 110   i also have a blog menu item  articles   category  blog  in the main menu  its item id is 180   in the site there s also a blog module that pull articles of the blog category   the problem is that no matter where i click a blog item link  in the homepage  the module or the actual blog menu item  it opens the blog article in item id 110  which is the homepage   most tutorials and answers say that the way around this is to create a specific menu item for the category   but i ve done this and still have the issue   any other ideas  	hopefully this helps answer the question  the reason your getting the 110 instead of the 180 itemdid is because your on the home page  most modules will pick up on the current itemid  in this case the home page  110   not the itemdid of the target menu  your looking for  articles aren t tied to itemdid s when they are created  the itemid id us purely a numerical value for a menu itemid   some blog modules allow you to set a target itemid  which would tie it to the proper menu itemid   the only reason i can think of that your itemdid s are being tied to 110 no matter what  even if your on the blog menu link with 180  is that your using an external link to land on the blog page  which is carrying the 110 itemid with it

following file   administrator templates isis js template js   please note that option 2 is considered a core hack  therefore if you install a joomla update and there have been some changes to the

2014-07-24T09:30:56.907	3738	php^&^database^&^variable	database query where   value is a number	as we know  any values that are defined in a database query should always be escaped in joomla using  db  quote  value      when defining numbers as a variable  one would normally use  int  to set it as an integer   so what would one do when setting a number as a value in a where   clause for a database query  would we only define it as an integer like so    id    int 555    where  db  quotename  id              id     or would we only need to quote it like so    id   555    where  db  quotename  id              db  quote  id      or would we do both    id    int 555    where  db  quotename  id              db  quote  id      could someone please shed some light just so that i know for future reference please  	good question this one  i have been in this consideration many times as well  not sure if there is one right answer and also not sure if my answer will be totally correct and clearly explained   from what i have seen so far  the database will understand a query containing a number  integer in a where statement  and will compare it with its records set  even if the field we are comparing is defined as an  int    text    varchar  or  char  type  with or without quotes   however one of the critical points in such cases is to have consistency when querying the database with the right data types  so when checking for an int field  the variable included in the query should always be transformed to an integer   doing so and passing an integer to the database  we are somewhat safe of what data we are sending    the database will understand and process the query   from my tests with this case  my general conclusion is that quoting the integer will not make any difference in the results and the whole stability   unless there are any specific cases that i can t think of at the moment  where quoting or not an integer will result in different or undesired results   so  it looks like that it comes down more to the coding style and the consistency of the code   with the above in mind  it seems that is not actually required to quote an integer   it will be interesting to investigate this throughout the joomla core  to see extensively their practices  or even better have an input from someone with an extensive knowledge and experience on this topic

2014-07-26T07:29:08.210	3760	php^&^templates^&^module	no more than one module in position	i was just wondering if there was some php that i could add to my template index php that would ensure only one module is loaded in a particular position   i know there are other options available such as advanced module manager but for this particular site it would be great if i could add some php directly to the page  basically if there are 2 modules being loaded into one position then i just want the first module to load   thanks  	i have to agree with lodder s comment    this is not making a real sense and it probably will create confusion   but for the sake of answering to your question and to help you find a way to achieve something like this  you could try the approach below     php   jimport   joomla application module helper        modules   jmodulehelper  getmodules   yourposition        attribs   array  style      xhtml          echo jmodulehelper  rendermodule  modules 0    attribs        the getmodules  position  function will load an array with all the modules in your position  ordered by module id   then  with the rendermodule  module  attributes  function  you output the module  but since you have an array  you need to tell which module you will render  by specifying the index of the array s element   but because there will still be a dynamic way of creating editing changing modules settings  i am not that sure how you could ensure what module will be rendered at the end  in the case that other users will be managing the website   so  if you would explain a little bit more what are you trying to achieve and why  we could propose you the right solution

2014-08-15T20:31:25.117	4066	component^&^sql^&^fof	component update  db error file function returned no error	i have been working on a component but noticed when i update it i get an error  something like  component update  db error file function returned no error   not exact but close    i notice this is due to the rows in the extension table  only the extension table   deleting them fixes it  but that is basically  uninstalling  the component without removing its files data  other then config   so its really not an option to do a preflight script and do that on update   due to the nature of the component i have a library that installs beside it  so i used f0f s installerscript tool  and extended it since it has no option to install libraries   f0f has a function called bugfixdbfunctionreturnednoerror   which fixes the error using the technique described above  however its made to do it in install in case it was uninstalled and left anything remaining  but i need it done on update   i did some changes to the installer script to make it run on update as well and it is working with that  however it is not the way around this problem  any thoughts on this  	figured out the issue  when making a component you need to have at least 1 blank update sql file or it will fail  not just the typical index html file to make sure then installer does not skip the folder   typically the file would be something like sql updates mysql version sql replacing version with the actual needed version  i am confident this is a bug  it should not require an sql file on update but it is not urgent if it is  either that or there is something else i am missing

2014-08-18T10:05:19.440	4087	security^&^maintenance	joomla tmp directory   what is it for and can i delete its content 	my joomla website currently uses about 100 mb of storage  i checked my folders and found out that the tmp folder is about 30mb and contains a number of files and folders named like  install 320e535e4332c2  some of these files are more recent  while others seems to be much older  more than 1 month     i checked a clean joomla install and found this folder empty     what is the actual need for this folder  would it be okay to delete its content on my live site   	you can definitely delete the files in the tmp directory and actually it is strongly recommended to do so and maintain it clean   you should only keep the index html file in place  that may prevent potential directory listing of the files   the tmp  temporary  folder is used by joomla and its extensions when performing software installations or during the system is handling files and needs a location to temporarily store them   in many cases these files get stuck in the tmp folder  apparently this may result to hd space issues  but there is also another bigger risk   since these files may come from old extensions once installed in your website  they can contain old vulnerable and insecure code   they can also be any kind of executable php files  or can contain other sensitive information which can be exposed    although your other security settings and your server configuration may be a safeguard  the best practice is to delete such files and keep your website clean  something that you should periodically perform   as mentioned above  you should only keep the index html file  for enhanced security you could also place an  htaccess file with rules to prevent web access to the folder   about tmp directory permissions   as said  tmp folder is used by the joomla system during installation  it s common situation when insufficient permissions or a wrong entry in the configuration for the path of the tmp directory  will cause installations to fail  in such case make sure that you have correctly set the path in the configuration file for the tmp directory and it has sufficient permissions   auto cleaning the tmp directory  for an automated process of auto cleaning the tmp folder alongside with lodder s suggestion for akeeba admin tools  i would recommend nonumber s cache cleaner plugin which provides a special setting for the tmp folder as well   in addition to  ffrewin s answer  if you do not have ftp access  you can clean the tmp folder using admin tools   the option for this is located on the admin tools control panel as shown in the below screenshot     as mentioned by ffrewin  the pro version of admin tools allows you to perform a scheduled clean up of the tmp directory   in addition to this  you can also install an extension from the tmp folder  by following these steps    in your tmp directory  create a new folder  for example helloworld extract your zip file on your computer and upload the contents to this newly created folder  depending on your ftp client  you could firstly upload the zip file and then extract it  in the joomla backend  go to extensions    extension manager and on the tabs below  select install from directory   you will see a predefined path  such as  home xxx public html tmp which you simply need to add your newly created folder on to  so it would be  home xxx public html tmp helloworld click install   the  tmp  folder is a place for the system to store files on a temporary basis  one of the most frequent uses of this folder is when extensions are installed  when a new extension is installed  a copy of the extension s archive file is copied into the  tmp  folder and then is unpacked into the correct joomla folders   the install process doesn t clean itself up automatically all the time  most of the time it will  if you are using the joomla installer  it depends on how the component s author wrote the install instructions  most of the time you don t need to do anything and when you quit adding modules and components  you won t have to worry about it   if you do a lot of component installations and reinstallations it will collect a lot of miscellaneous session files  plus copies of zip files  so checking it periodically isn t a bad idea   either you do it using ftp or the file manager  as mentioned in details by friends up in this page or cron if you know how  or if you have akeeba administrative tools installed there is a button on its control panel that will clear the temp directory for you

2014-08-20T15:00:56.923	4136	administrator^&^configuration^&^account-password	joomla works without my new ftp password  how that s possible 	i changed my database password and i have changed it in the configuration php file but concerning my ftp password i can t find where i need to change it in joomla   the weird things is that my new ftp password is effective  i tested it with filezila  but somehow joomla can still connect to the ftp even though i haven t updated it anywhere in joomla  actually i could not find it where i am supposed to change the ftp password  i have checked the configuration php and the global configuration in the administrator    is this normal   if it is  how can joomla  3 3 1  retrieve the  css   php  etc  files without having the ftp password   	to change the ftp settings in joomla  go to    joomla backend global configuration select the server tab  under ftp settings   set   enable ftp   to   yes    which will then slide down the required options for you til fill in    these settings only need to be added in if your server requires you to use ftp within joomla  i was a little confused with your question so i will simply write a few facts down here   you obviously already have an ftp account which i assume you ve created in your hosting control panel  if you are adding files to your joomla site via ftp and have changed the password for the account  you will not be able to connect  no if s or buts  it simply will not allow you to connect  it is quite possible that you have created a separate ftp account and are still connecting via the old account  if you wish to change the password  be sure to update the current account   maybe you are referring to an anonymous ftp account  not entirely sure    
2014-08-20T20:22:55.480	4145	development	is there a way to have two joomla sites on the same virtual host 	we have an existing site  version 1  we want to build a new version of the site  version 2 in a new joomla instance so that we can ensure a cleaned up code base  but we want to do it incrementally  one component at a time    is there a clean way in joomla so that we can host version 2 but still serve components from version 1 until they re replaced with corresponding version 2 components  	sub folders is the best way  using a typical cpanel style install as an example     home account public html is the main site    home account public html new site is the new site   using a  htaccess and  htpasswd  if using apache  you can block unwanted traffic to the new site  you can also use the same database with a different prefix as well  or just a use different database  less complicated to clean later    joomla is great at understanding where it sits on a server  so all you need to do is go to domain com new site and as long as your configuration php file is set up correctly it should load the same as the current site  and moving it later will not hurt it   actually it would be a bad idea to have a joomla site nested inside the root of another joomla instance  the better scenario  which would require shell access to configure  is to have each one in it s directory outside of the webroot  and symlink the files into the webroot  this way the new site can be accessed via a subdomain during testing and content could be moved between databases  when it s time to switch over  simply delete the symlink from the old site and link the new site into the webroot   this would also make it possible to source control the entire site with git or mercurial and run a pull only scenario for your production version without having to create a complicated deployment script   
2014-08-20T21:35:05.463	4147	seo^&^performance	is there a way to reduce document waiting time 	our document has a very high waiting time and very low receiving time      is there a way to get the document to start receiving earlier   	the waiting time is basically the time it takes your server to understand what it should do  when you send a request to a server  it will take time from the initial contact to when it sends its response  waiting   so the only way to speed up the waiting time is to speed up your server  now that can be done with more then just a server upgrade though   so here are some questions to ask yourself to help troubleshoot   how many extensions do you have  do some pages take longer then others   if so what exact extensions load on those pages or are there alternatives  is joomla up to date  can you test an upgrade and see if that helps  with backup ready   can you live with out them  is the server taking a high load   but in all honesty for 14ish kb of data and 500ms to load it  its not lightning fast but in my opinion nothing to really worry about to much either  although the image does not show the actual waiting time  this page totaled 320 ms with 12kb and this is stackoverflow  not a huge difference   optimizing your database and making sure your extensions are efficient is the best way to lower it without going into your actual server settings

2014-08-21T16:57:14.723	4164	menu-item^&^seo^&^url	how to deal with duplicated content   urls in joomla 	i just found out a major seo issue and while i have solved it for the time being  i am trying to figure out why it may have occurred in the first place and if there was mistake or is it something to do with joomla itself  first the issue   when i crawled a site with moz  it showed four duplicate content for the homepage which was unexpected  so for example for the homepage http   www foo com it was showing duplicate content urls like the following   foo com 2 uncategorised 1 offers  canonical   foo com 2 uncategorised 1 offers  foo com 2 uncategorised 2 enquiry  canonical   foo com 2 uncategorised 2 enquiry  foo com 2 uncategorised 3 products  canonical   foo com 2 uncategorised 3 products     and all of these links were simply loading the homepage content yet the meta details were from the article  this obviously indicated that joomla was auto creating the links and i found the same for the 4 links  the link in the article were like this   index php option com content view article id 1 catid 2 itemid 1 index php option com content view article id 2 catid 2 itemid 1 index php option com content view article id 3 catid 2 itemid 1  the itemid   1 corresponds to the homepage menu item which explains why the homepage was loading  i tried recreating the issue but could not  according to the folks who added the content  here is the steps they did when creating those articles and links within it    create articles add link to other articles using  article  tab in the content editor   create menu item to the articles   so i was wondering if there is something obviously wrong here  i am confused because there is over 100 articles yet this happened only in about 5 articles  thanks  	why the articles are being displayed under the same itemid  first of all  this is not the problem why you are getting duplicate urls  the articles are using the home page s item id  because there is no other item id assigned for them  read more on how to deal with this in this relative question     how  duplicate content  is being generated  this is actually a standard behavior for dynamic websites that generate their pages by using url parameters to construct query strings in the form of field value pairs   the server application will receive the query  process it and return the associative content to the browser   to understand better this you might want to disable sef urls in a joomla website and study a little the non sef url of a page   example        index php option com content view article id 3 catid 9 itemid 101   splitting the above query into fields value pairs we see      option   com content view   article id   3 catid   9 itemid   101   these are fields valus that joomla understands and will try to return the following content as   it will query in the com content component and use an article view to display the content item  article  with id 3  of the category id 9  using the menu item with id 101     many url variations for 1 page  however the same article can be displayed with even more fields values combination   some possible combinations could be           index php option com content view article id 3 catid 9     index php option com content view article id 3 itemid 101     index php option com content view article id 3 itemid 102     index php option com content view article id 3 itemid 103     index php option com content view article id 3     index php option com content view article id 3 lang en     index php option com content view article id 3 catid 9 itemid 101 lang en   index php option com content view article id 3 catid 9 itemid 101 lang en print 1   index php option com content view article id 3 catid 9 itemid 101 lang en tmpl component      as you can see  all the above are requesting the same data from the system  which is the article with id   3  these leads to the fact that the same content page can be accessed through various different urls and in some cases can be displayed in different layouts     the seo perspective  modern search engines and google particularly  are aware of this behavior  usually they will try their best  to index and keep in their search results the most suitable url for a page   in addition  google has revealed that there is no actual   penalty   for duplicated content due to this    however  the main issues in the case that the same content page has been indexed more than once  are that you possibly are loosing rankings and the best possible seo performance   because rankings will be split into more than 1 page instead of 1   with this in mind  it is wise to deal with this and not let the search engines try to do the hard job or guess this for you  moreover dealing with this  can produce an overall better user experience  when site users can only find the same page under 1 only standard url  and it can produce a more solid structure for a website and its management     how to deal with duplicate content   using canonical urls for your pages  canonical urls will instruct the search engine about which is supposed the right url of a page that they should crawl and keep in their index   using index noindex  follow nofollow metadata  using such metadata in your pages  will instruct search engines if you want them to index or not the content of a page and to follow or not the links found on it  using 301 redirects  you can redirect all other urls to the one that you want at the main  using google webmasters tools google webmasters tools have options to adjust how the crawler should behave with your url parameters  using sitemaps submit to the search engines your site s url structure  using robots txt file google and other major se are respecting your robots txt  you can instruct them to not crawl specific directories url paths    all the above options can be combined in order to produce the desired outcome     joomla seo extensions  usually in joomla if you want to deal with this efficiently you would end up installing a 3rd party seo sef extension       jed  seo extensions   jed  sef extensions       more

2014-08-28T15:55:36.837	4253	component	proper folder structure for custom component	i m trying to use the joomlatools joomla console in a new project  however  i can t use the symlink functionality because of my directory structure    in the past i ve always built components with a simple   administrator      controllers     models     views     etc site     controllers     models     views     etc   structure  and it works fine when you zip   install it   joomlatools says you should use   administrator    components      mycomponent          controllers       models       views       etc site    components      mycomponent        controllers       models       views       etc   structure   what do you use and which is  right   	no structure is wrong  the nice thing about joomla is it does not force you  your first one in the aspect of it being structured within an install able archive i would say is the closest to standard  some developers prefer everything in one directory  others prefer 2 3 well split folders  some even might have a folder for every file  nothing is incorrect in the end as it all  works   though personally although i have no experience with joomlatools  if that structure is meant for the install archive it seems rather  excessive   no real reason for 2 of the folder levels   this next part is not directly related to the question  also for symlink i don t think it can ever really work  if any file references another file its going to look for it based on the  real  file  so if you have root installable file php going to root joomla file php it assumes you are in root installable   there may be a way around that but i found a better alternative that does not have as many potential issues  rsync  of course you need command line but i have this working on a shared host even with limited ssh access      bin bash    sync rsync  r  home joomla components com component administrator    home joomla public html administrator components com component  rsync  r  home joomla components com component site    home joomla public html components com component  rsync  r  home joomla components com component administrator language    home joomla public html administrator language    it got a bit to it but you can see that with any folder structure you can map the files to the proper folder  you only need to install it once to get the database records  and again if you change anything   you may also be able to just use cp  but this worked for me so i had no reason to change  and has the ability to work across servers    though this needs to be run every time you do an update  but not to hard once you get the hang of it  you can also do it in reverse and instead just edit straight on your dev site for the component  again there may be a way around that  just have not worked on it yet

2014-08-29T09:04:26.373	4264	url^&^multilingual^&^mod-languages	multilingual with single article for home page   duplicate home url issue	i have set up a multilingual site  but rather using the featured articles menu item as home   i used a single article menu item  menu items  categories  articles are all associated among the languages   if i use the home menu item from the main menu  it works fine    the issue is that mod languages generates duplicate url for the home pages  when i am in the home page and want to change language    so instead of going to  www mysite com en      it goes to  www mysite com en home   so  currently there are 2 obvious duplicate urls for all my home pages    joomla 3 3 3 	the issue comes from the mod languages  because currently it will always check for the component s associations and if it finds them  it will create that url for the page  although in this case  we might just wanted to use only the association from the menu items for homes and skip the component s associations  i am not that sure that this should always work for each case and every home page setup though    the easiest way to overcome this  is to un associate those articles that are used by the home page menuitems  so the mod languages will just use the menu items associations

2014-08-30T06:48:46.740	4275	development^&^php	sorting by the publish up value	i have a  php that retrieve fields from my joomla database and then echo them with a foreach function  here are just the relevant part of the code      php                       jquery1    select  fulltext  alias metakey publish up metadesc from kms content  where catid 22 and state   1       jdb1  setquery   jquery1       jfeed1   jdb1  loadobjectlist      foreach   jfeed1 as  jitem1       li    div      php                                     oldlocale   setlocale lc time   en us      echo strftime   a  d  b  y   strtotime  jitem1  publish up       setlocale lc time   oldlocale           div    div   php echo  jitem1  fulltext      div    li     php endforeach       so everything works great except that my array entries are sort by id  i would like them to be sorted out by the date  by the publish up value  i have tried this code but it s giving a blank page with only the title at the top     jfeed1   jdb1  loadobjectlist     function date compare  a   b        t1   strtotime  a  publish up         t2   strtotime  b  publish up        return  t1    t2        usort  jfeed1   date compare    foreach   jfeed1 as  jitem1     i ve  learned  php just by looking at codes and reading tuto  so i am missing a lot of fondamental notions  essential when i have to put theory into practice  i am confused here about array and object and i can t figure out what i am supposed to do to solve this warning  thanks for your help   edit 1     php     var dump  jfeed1       gives me for the first item       array 22     0    object stdclass  318  5       fulltext     string 212   yesterday         alias     string 3   237     metakey     string 7   france     publish up     string 19   2011 11 15 09 06 39     	there are probably other differences  or maybe not  http   stackoverflow com questions 2193049 php objects vs arrays   between objects and arrays  but it is mostly a style difference  at least when using a stdclass object    for objects  you use the syntax of  variable  property and for arrays you use  variable  property     var dump will usually show an array style syntax  though that is not what you want to use if you see stdclass   meaning it is an object   so your date compare function should use  a  publish up and  b  publish up within the strtotime calls  that should get that to actually use the values and thus actually sort     you can also skip all the sorting bit in php by just ordering in the sql statement    jquery1    select  fulltext  alias metakey publish up metadesc from kms content  where catid 22 and state   1  order by publish up desc    jdb1  setquery   jquery1     jfeed1   jdb1  loadobjectlist       not sure exactly what order you want  so if it is backwards  change the desc at the end to asc  descending v  ascending        and finally  the obligatory  other joomla best practices that you should use  section   obviously your code can work without these  but they leverage some of the nicer features of joomla    the biggest one is to avoid putting the table prefix in the query  always reference a table by starting with       if you ever share code between two sites  it is likely you ll change the prefix and that will be the only thing that needs to change in the code to make it work in the new site  so save yourself trouble and just always type        second  joomla s query object is a great way to build queries and have it automatically work for other database types  even if you never use them now  and also just has it escape things for you  definitely worth learning about  http   docs joomla org selecting data using jdatabase  you can use the following query    jquery1    jdb1  getquery true                    select   fulltext   alias  metakey  publish up  metadesc                     from     content                     where   catid    22                     where   state    1                     order  publish up desc       or   order  publish up asc

2014-09-04T11:32:13.433	4333	database^&^tags^&^search	uploading tags in bulk	i was wondering if it s possible to upload a list of tags to the database in bulk  and if so  how   i need to upload a few hundred tags  all years 1901   1902   1903 etc        the reason i want to do this is because i need to be able to tag images with a specific year  and by clicking on the  year  tag i should then be shown all images from that year  the problem is the website is a historical based on so some of the images date back hundreds of years   i would rather not edit the database without knowing firstly if it s possible  and secondly what i m doing   if there are any other solutions i am open to suggestion  however this one seems easiest to me  	there is no import option for the tags component  this will make a such import directly into the database a tough process  as you will have to take into consideration all the fields of the table for each row  an insert statement for each row would look like this   insert into  cpxns tags    id    parent id    lft    rgt    level    path    title    alias    note    description    published    checked out    checked out time    access    params    metadesc    metakey    metadata    created user id    created time    created by alias    modified user id    modified time    images    urls    hits    language    version    publish up    publish down       values          4  1  3  4  1   1910    1910   x 31393130           1  0   0000 00 00 00 00 00   1      tag layout          tag link class     label label info     image intro          float intro          image intro alt          image intro caption          image fulltext          float fulltext          image fulltext alt          image fulltext caption                       author          robots           441   2014 09 04 13 17 21       0   0000 00 00 00 00 00           0       1   0000 00 00 00 00 00    0000 00 00 00 00 00      which requires a lot of manual writing  in addition  tags are using the nested set model to build parents childs associations and this requires a lot of calculations in order to find the right values for the relative fields  batch processing or re saving of tags has not been proved to fix these issues for tags component and acl manager  3rd party extension  does not deal with it    so unless there is another script that will deal with all the above and let you batch import a file with tags  then your best chance is to create them manually from the backend  or during content creation   those are my first thoughts on this  but maybe someone has another better idea suggestion     
2014-09-04T12:28:21.667	4334	articles^&^menu-item^&^layout	articles with no menu item	i was hoping somebody could explain this to me as i cannot seem to get my head around it   i have a website with numerous articles and categories  all displayed at mydomain com blog  my homepage  mydomain com  is set to articles   category blog   and set to show one single article from the category  front page    the problem is that whenever i click to read more about the article  it does infact show me more but stays on the homepage  i e with all the various modules still in place   do i need to create a hidden menu and set this as my homepage  or am i way off    basically i want to be able to click an article title on my homepage and be taken to a new  fresh page displaying only that article  i know it s possible to use advanced module manager aswell  but i don t think it s necessary    i know this must be pretty basic stuff  but i d like to understand it better  	i would suggest some organizational restructure like below   instead of using a special category named   front page   use the   featured articles   option  to specify which articles you consider to appear in the home page   then assign your blog articles to their relative context category and not to a special one for the front page   for the blog  you can either use a category blog layout item using the parent blog category  and set it to display articles from all child categories  or if you like you could even create a hidden menu with blog category layout menu type for each blog articles category you have  this will make your articles being displayed under the menu item of each category   for the front page  use the featured articles menu type  and choose the categories from which you want it to show featured articles and set it to display 1 leading article   hope it makes sense   let me know if you need further clarification  it would also help  if you present your current articles organization structure  categories and child categories

2014-09-16T04:59:46.753	4462	joomla-3.x^&^security^&^account-password	how  re set password for admin after migration from 1 5 	i migrated an old joomla 1 5 site to a shiny new joomla 3 3 version using the tool sp upgrade     now i can t seem to login and i fear its because all the user passwords in the db look like  md5   salt  which is the old way to create passwords    i understand the newer code uses a based password  all of the methods i see described about pasting in the old style  secret  password are not working    how do i reset a password in joomla 3 3  	here is a workaround to temporary reset your password for your account     login to your hosting panel and use the database tool that is available  probably phpmyadmin    load the appropriate database and then go to the jos users table   the database prefix might be different for your case   go to the browse view of the phpmyadmin  so you get view of the users records   locate your account and click to edit  or click directly in the  password  field  usually phpmyadmin  will make the field editable with this    in the password field paste the value below         2y 10 jszamznv7u2q4vetqdw7n cx hpekafc8sxa9 n0v2gp t  xvhyi    do not apply any special functions for saving the field and it will set your account password to admin  save the record    you can now login with your account  using as password  admin   after login  make sure you set your desired password   in addition to ffrewin s fine answer  here s a couple of alternative ways to reset the admin password    notice remember that most of these methods will set your password to something simple like admin   it s very important to set a stronger password afterwards  if there is reason to believe the site has been hacked  you might want to remove other users with admin access once you ve recovered access to your joomla installation  these methods are partly taken from joomla docs    alternative 1  configuration php file  if you are able to log in with another user  without super admin rights   it is possible to add this line to the bottom of the configuration php file in your joomla root directory   public  root user  myname     replace myname with the username of any user you know the password of  with author rights or higher   this user will now be able to log in as superadministrator  and you can edit add users in the user manager  remember to remove the extra line from your configuration php file when you re done  either by letting joomla try to do it automatically when prompted  or by editing the file manually   alternative 2  add new super admin user  a new super administrator user can be created using this method    open phpmyadmin  or similar  depending on your hosting  and select the database for the joomla  site  press the  sql  button in the toolbar to run an sql query on the selected database  this will display a field called  run sql query queries on database    delete any text in this field and copy and paste the following query below and press the go button to execute the query and add the new administrator user to the table   insert into  jos31 users    name    username    password    params   values   administrator2    admin2    d2064d358136996bd22421584a7cb33e trd7tvkhx6dmeommbvxymg0vuxea4199        insert into  jos31 user usergroup map    user id   group id   values  last insert id    8     remember to replace the two occurrences of jos31  with the prefix used by your joomla installation  this is usually easily spotted in phpmyadmin   you can now access your site with username admin2 and password secret   make sure to edit your password once you ve logged in    alternative 3   create a php file with the code below  upload it to your joomlaroot administrator directory  and run it in your browser  it will log you in instantly  both joomla 2 5 and 3   and allow you to add edit users  remember to remove the file once you re done  failure to do so will represent a huge security issue   the tool can also be found here  http   myext eu en j25 login    php define   jexec   1   define  ds   directory separator    if  file exists dirname   file

2014-09-18T14:41:10.883	4492	articles^&^subcategories	list articles by category and sub category	it seems unbelievably difficult to display a list of articles  grouped by their category subcategory with the category as a sub heading   the articles category module seems to come close as i can choose to group the articles by category but it would be really cool if i could show the group title  ie  the category  as a heading for each group   any ideas how i might be able to do this by customising the default php module layout   or any other way to achieve a nice neat list of articles with category subheadings  	option 1  create a menu for your categories and articles  everytime you add an article to your category  you also add it to your menu  then you use the menu module to call in that information  it ll be a menu  but it ll look like categories and articles   option 2  create multiple modules  one for each category  and call them all into that space  they ll tile on top of each other  pull the relevant articles  and look as though they are one unit  even though they are several   option 3  hit the joomla extension directory for other article and category displaying modules and see what you find  i like display news  but i m not sure off the top of my head that it ll do exactly what you re looking for   option4  this just occurred to me  it s a little crazy  and it s more or less used to organize option 2 and make it a little more dynamic  using article categories  instead of article category  you call the category list into your website  make sure you also call the category descriptions  then in the description of each category  you call a module for that category that lists its articles   now it really is one unit  but it s pulling pieces from your modules  articles and categories   whatever you do  make sure you have a top level menu item for your category blog  to ensure your articles take the styles you want

2014-09-19T02:29:39.587	4495	acl	how to correctly save and understand acl rules when creating categories from php	we re doing a massive import of categories from another cms  and using the below code to create the categories    basepath   jpath administrator   components com categories   require once  basepath   models category php    config    array  table path      basepath   tables     catmodel   new categoriesmodelcategory  config      populate the params array with values to save  for rules   params  rules     array       core edit state     array         core edit delete     array         core edit edit     array         core edit state     array         core edit edit own     array 1  true     if   catmodel  save  params       return false    this all works marvelously  creating the category  with the permissions as expected   however  examining other categories that have been manually added along the way  all with the same parent id ancestry  i see two different varieties of the rules column in the    assets table       assets rules example  1    as created by the above code  and some with admin category manager  in use by many categories           core create           core delete           core edit           core edit state           core edit own    1  1         assets rules example  2    as created by the admin category manager  and in use by many categories           core create    6  1  3  1        core delete    6  1        core edit    6  1  4  1        core edit state    6  1  5  1        core edit own    1  1  6  1  3  1      when i view them in the category manager  both categories appear to have the same permissions   inheriting everything except  edit own  being set to  allowed    so  the real question is two fold    what are the differences between these two sets of rules is the method we re using  yielding example  1  incomplete in anyway  	the rules column in the assets table define the custom rules for each item individually   the default value of the field would be     core create      core delete      core edit      core edit state      core edit own        which means that all permission rules for this item inherit their permissions from the default global configuration settings as specified for each group   otherwise  there are permissions overrides by item     core create    6  1  3  1   core delete    6  1   core edit    6  1  4  1   core edit state    6  1  5  1   core edit own    6  1  3  1     explanation of the what a value of core create    6  1  3  0  means   for this item the group id 6 has create permissions set to   allowed    1   while the group id 3 has create permissions set to   denied    0    these permissions override the default global permissions  and all other permissions for the rest groups are inherited    hope this helps

i assume that s the piece i am missing  i am unsure of how to go about coding it though  i have some  get  methods in my model  but would this be a  set  method  or how do i call a function from the controller and pass it the input from the html view  	to start  it would probably be best to go through all of this  http   docs joomla org j2 5 developing a mvc component developing a basic component   it s a lot of information  but it will definitely help answer a lot of your questions     let s start with the form  there are a few pieces that you can do to get this to point at the controller function    form name  upload  method  post  enctype  multipart form data        input type  file  name  file upload          input type  submit  value  upload image          input type  hidden  name  option  value  com component name          input type  hidden  name  task  value  controller method           php echo jhtml      form token          form    i ve added two hidden inputs to the form  these two fields route the posted data  the first one should match your component  the second can either be just a method name  if you are routing to the base controller php file in the root of your component  or it should use this  dot syntax  to specify the controller and method   your case would probably just be upload since that looks like the base controller to me    the extra php bit at the end adds a csrf token to help prevent csrf attacks  you can read more about it here  http   docs joomla org how to add csrf anti spoofing to forms   the part to check for this token is already at the top of the upload function     now that you are actually getting your upload function to run on the form submission  we need to process the file   don t bother using the jrequest class for input  it is deprecated and will go away soon  use jinput as outlined here  http   docs joomla org retrieving request data using jinput    pretty much everything before the following line isn t probably necessary for the task at hand  it allows customization that you don t really need for now    files   array map  array  this   reformatfilesarray         array   files  name     array   files  type     array   files  tmp name     array   files  error     array   files  size        because we are using jinput now  we can instead do this like so    app   jfactory  getapplication     files    app  input  files  get  file upload      i believe all of the rest of the interating on the  files array should work  you will want to check whether  files is an array of files or just a single level array of a file  in the latter case  you don t need the foreach      that should be enough for this question  i can almost guarantee that you will have more questions  this question is already fairly broad

2014-09-22T13:56:38.653	4534	joomla-3.x^&^mysql	why doesn t joomla use foreign keys in the core table structures 	i am developing a custom component and want to use a foreign key user id referenced to    users id    i noticed that joomla doesn t use any foreign key in its core tables for example in    user notes or user profiles    assume that i want to create an extension for adding comments to articles  the structure of the table is like so   create table if not exists     comp comments         id  int 10  unsigned not null auto increment       user id  int 20  unsigned not null       comment  text      primary key   id          placeholder         now i have two options     foreign key   user id   references     users   id   on update cascade on delete cascade   and    key  idx userid    user id     what is your suggestion  using foreign keys in custom components or not  and why  	joomla of course uses foreign keys to reference primary keys in other tables  that s a basic concept in databases and it wouldn t work otherwise   what you mean is something different  you re talking about binding them together so they keep the integrity on a database level  eg if a row in the primary table is deleted  the  child  tables gets their rows deleted as well automatically  or you can only delete the primary if all childs are deleted first  that depends a bit on how it s set up  this is called  referential integrity    in joomla  we don t use the referential integrity  we instead keep our data sane on an application level  various plugin events lets you catch a delete or changed state or whatever and act accordingly

2014-09-25T03:10:13.503	4573	joomla-3.x^&^component^&^css^&^layout	standard css classes   id naming conventions	when building a custom component  and while designing the layout file to render the view  i m having difficulty determining what css classes   id s to use in my html elements to ensure it takes advantage of joomla built in css and other templates   i understand that joomla uses bootstrap which provides a level of consistency and can be referenced here  http   getbootstrap com 2 3 2 base css html  however  besides the bootstrap implementation  are there any standard css classes id s that i can use to ensure consistency across the many templates that are available  and if so  are there any references to these css classes id s   i guess i m asking if you were to design the look and feel of the component  what steps would you take to ensure that the look and feel works in synergy with joomla and other templates  	i wish there was a solution to this but unfortunately there isn t  it would be great if we could all develop extensions that would integrate with all templates out there   you would simply be best making use of the bootstrap classes and if the style doesn t integrate well  then the user can simply create a template override for your component   just be sure to make everything as dynamic as possible    you may have noticed if you ever look into 3rd party module code  that many of them put the html markup in mod modulename php   meaning that the user cannot override the view  and thus has to perform a core hack to style the module according to their needs   this is why all markup should always be put in the view file   hope this helps     what steps would you take to ensure that the look and feel works in synergy with joomla and other templates    there s no way of knowing what will  and what will not  be supported in a template so my advice would be to not rely on a template to style your component at all  it is impossible to ensure the look and feel  that it ultimately decided by the template   there s three possible approaches  1  do nothing  2  hope that the template will support bs2 or bs3 syntax and pick one of those  or 3  include your own css   using the correct html elements for the job will mean that the template handles most of your styling anyway  option 1   for anything else use a logical class naming approach for your component elements  following the joomla coding standards for html and css and include your own css with your component  if you do this please provide a switch to disable it    as i template developer i do the styling for any component i use  i neither need nor want component styles though i appreciate that some might  the best way is to provide simple options in your extension configuration  load css  yes no  load js  yes no  failing that  please ensure that they are at least loaded from the view file so that they can be overridden without hacking your extension

2014-09-29T16:38:50.863	4675	navigation^&^pagination	joomla pagination loop without start or end	how can i achieve loop pagination  lets say i have 5 articles  im adding pagination and on the 1 st page i have  next  button  on pages 2 4 i have both  next  and  prev  buttons  on the last 5 th page i will have only  prev  button  how can i have  next  and  prev  buttons both on every page  so after reaching 5 th page and pressing  next  im going to 1 st page  like loop or circle  	the article pagination is handled by a content plugin called pagenavigation   located in root plugins content pagenavigation   the problem is that although joomla allows for plugin overrides   most plugins don t support it  including this particular plugin  either way  the code you have to change is in pagenavigation php in the aforementioned folder  at aprox  line  174    change the existing code           if   location   1    0                           the previous content item cannot be in the array position  1               row  prev    rows  location   1                      if    location   1    count  rows                            the next content item cannot be in an array position greater than the number of array postions               row  next    rows  location   1               with this           if   location   1    0                           the previous content item cannot be in the array position  1               row  prev    rows  location   1             else                  add button to return to last element              row  prev    rows count  rows  1                      if    location   1    count  rows                            the next content item cannot be in an array position greater than the number of array postions               row  next    rows  location   1             else                  add button to return to start              row  next    rows 0               as far as i know  you have three ways to solve this    edit the original file  as above  this is called a core hack  and not recommended  because your edits might be overwritten when you update joomla   create a new plugin based on the existing plg pagenavigation   and apply the edits  then publish your new plugin and unpublish pagenavigation   make the plugin compatible with plugin overrides by adding this code to root plugins content pagenavigation pagenavigation php   right after defined   jexec   or die      chromepath   jpath themes         jfactory  getapplication    gettemplate       html pagenavigation php   if  file exists  chromepath   require once   chromepath    if   function exists  plgcontentnavigation        function plgcontentnavigation    row    params   page 0         then this at the end of the file          this will make joomla look for the file root templates yourtemplate html pagenavigation php and use it as override if it exists  it s still a core hack  but it might be easier to maintain

2014-10-27T10:50:14.440	4953	joomla-3.3.x^&^bootstrap	how can i completely remove bootstrap from the frontend of joomla 	recently  i tried to remove all instances of bootstrap from the front end of joomla for debugging purposes   i was using a skeleton template with a relatively new installation of joomla 3 3  i removed all inclusions of bootstrap from the template and i turned off all plugins and modules that i thought could be loading it  i also cleared joomla cache  despite that  firebug told me that joomla was still trying to load bootstrap min js from  media jui js bootstrap min js  i got round the problem by temporarily renaming the bootstrap file  but it got me wondering     does this happen with all joomla 3 3 installations or is just mine  is there a way i can identify where bootstrap is being loaded from  is there a way i can disable bootstrap from loading   	this is something that has bugged me since the beginning of joomla 3 x and still to this day  nothing has been done to give the user the option to prevent the bootstrap files from being loaded   unfortunately  bootstrap gets loaded from the core of joomla and this is due to some core features that require it to work  thus removing it completelt will prevent some features from working such as the tooltip   the only way to remove it is via a core hack in the following file      libraries cms html bootstrap php   the only other way i can think of is create a template override for every module  component and plugin that calls the bootstrap library and remove it   neither method is nice however joomla 3 x was built on bootstrap so we have to live with it  just an idea  not tested   but how about building a small plugin that unsets bootstrap   something like this   public function onafterrender           get the array containing all the script declarations       document   jfactory  getdocument           headdata    document  getheaddata          scripts    headdata  scripts            remove script      unset  scripts   media jui js bootstrap min js           headdata  scripts      scripts        document  setheaddata  headdata       an alternate hack that i always like to throw out  since it doesn t involve editing core files is to override the css file with a blank css file in your template  this will still lead to a call to your server to load the resource  but you won t have to have any bootstrap styling   just add an empty file here  templates your template css jui bootstrap min css and templates your template js jui bootstrap min js    naturally any component setup to use bootstrap will look unstyled  and there will still be a call to load the css and js files by the browser  however  the files will be empty  small download size  and have no impact on the styling

2014-11-13T19:59:52.020	5220	joomla-3.3.x^&^javascript^&^gantry	optimizing frontend load  how do i properly combine and compress my js 	my website for an enterprise client has approximately 90 assets that download on load  35 or so are js files   even  optimizing  extensions that are made for joomla only seem to get me down to 31 or so js files and compress only the combined css js and not the ones that seem to run rogue   i ve tried a few of the optimizing free plugins  and i m reluctant to spend money on the paid ones if they re going to do very little for my load times   my template is a rockettheme base with a lot of customization  so it has gantry js  bootstrap js  a couple extensions like my video player use a js file  etc  and they seem to be spread out to a couple per extension instead of just one     what works and what doesn t for improving this part of front end load  	it won t be easy to deal with all these files  combining  minifying and compressing all these together will most probably bring issues  it will take much effort and a combination of techniques to reach a satisfactory optimization level     my overall approach to achieve a fast loading site   a fast website is essential  the speed optimization of a website  although it usually takes places at the end of the development  it is something that should be considered from the beginning  it starts with the proper template    also installing each and every extension  and using any kind of fancy modules  it probably result to a heavy website  that will be very hard to make it lighter later on    be eclectic   stay minimal  personally  when it comes to speed optimization  i try to be very eclectic on what extensions i use  i research and experiment for the most efficient and quality ones for each task  and always try to avoid to use any extensions  if there are things that can be achieved manually within the core    also  if i have to decide on using a fancy front end feature not really important  that causes me troubles in speed optimizing the website  i usually will throw it away  or find another way to implement the fancy feature   i also try to avoid to use commercial templates  since they usually come with many extra features to satisfy many different tastes  i prefer to build the template and include only what i need   your manual work  i would suggest to review all the extensions you have to see how they load their assets files  and if it s possible to avoid load them in pages where you don t need them  e g  you could create template overrides where possible to control on your own the loading of the assets files     you might find that there are extensions that you don t need   but are still loaded  or you don t have the optimum settings on how they should work  e g  jce mediabox provides option to be loaded only in specific menu items   also see if it s possible to merge files in one  e g  don t let any module to load it s css  try to merge it with the template s css file     optimization tools  css javascript compression   control as for optimization tools plugins  i am pretty happy with the jch optimize plugin  it s free  but also has a commercial version with support for a few bucks  with the proper tweaking  it can produce great results and the developer is quite helpful if you need support   another tool that might be proved useful  is the jquery easy plugin   it can help to better organize and control the loading of various javascript files  in the case they conflict with each other and make the optimization with jch optimize plugin easier   cache i also use jot cache   to have better control over the cache  since many extensions have issues with the core cache   cdn using cdn to deliver static content is the next tool   i use nonumber cdn for joomla  htaccess finally  big benefits you will gain by using an htaccess to compress and add expire headers to the files

shown on the left side of the blog entry  at the moment it is only possible to open the full article when you click on the title of the blog entry   now  what i want is  that i can click on the title and the intro image to open the full article  is that possible  and how can i achieve it   additional information  i use joomla version 3 3 6 and the afterburner2 template with gantry framework   thanks for any help   oodoloo  edit  2  findings after first response   thanks for your reply anibal   okay  generally i think i understand what to do  but it doesn t work the way i want        i tried the following before i want to add the article link to the image   first i edited the file  intro image php  at the location templates my template html layouts joomla content   i changed line 18 to  echo  class  caption test       title      htmlspecialchars  images  image intro caption           after that i excepted  when i inspect the site with developer tools  that i will find an img tag with the additional class  test   but i cant t find it  i think that was the override variant    in the next step i changed the file  intro image php  at the location layouts joomla content in the same way  but after that i still could not detect any changes when i inspect the site again   that s the first problem  with that changes  i only want to ensure that i m on the correct place for my changes   in the article i also set a caption  so that the edited line should be processed   the second problem i will have   you say  that i have to edit line 41 to reach my needs  but i m not sure in which way  can you give one more example please  sorry  but i still at the beginning of my php joomla career       	yes  you can change components com content views category tmpl blog item php   in that file  line 55  it shows how to generate an url to the article    link   jroute    contenthelperroute  getarticleroute  this  item  slug   this  item  catid      in line 41  it shows how the images is generated     php echo jlayouthelper  render  joomla content intro image    this  item        you can combine both to add the link to the image   in addition  remember to create blog item php as a layout component override at template level  instead of changing the core file   http   docs joomla org understanding output overrides layouts  ok  i found the solution  all the information provided above were correct and helped me to solve it completely  thank you  the central issue was that i do my changes in the wrong file  i think that the template  afterburner2  doesn t use neither the core files  under  sitename layouts joomla content intro image php  from joomla nor the files for override  under  sitename templates templatename html layouts joomla content   when you want to change the intro image part and you use the  afterburner2  template you have to edit the file under  sitename plugins system gantry overrides 3 3 2 5 com content category blog item php  on line 123 132 you can find the part for the intro image     php  if  isset  images  image intro  and  empty  images  image intro          php  imgfloat    empty  images  float intro      params  get  float

conform the code a little bit   thanks for each tip i get   additionally i want to say  that i think i edited the core files which the template afterburner2 uses   it is not a override i think  i will look for it  but if somebody know a better way to do  for example a override  i would be glad of another solution   after a little more research and antoher hints from ffrewin  again  thank you  at this point     i think a found another solution without edit the core file   i copied the file  blog item php  from the folder  sitename plugins system gantry overrides 3 3 2 5 com content category  where the core files stored  to the following location  sitename templates  templatename html joomla 3 3 com content category  when the file is stored there and contains the modifications i described before it also works for me   the folder  sitename templates  templatename html joomla does exist but in there only the folders  3 0    3 1    3 2  does exist  because i use the the joomla version  3

in the folder  category  i copied the file blog item php from  sitename plugins system gantry overrides 3 3 2 5 com content category   i think that is a better solution  because you must not touch the

2014-11-21T16:16:32.107	5333	joomla-3.x^&^development^&^content	how is content  locking  handled in custom components 	default core s com content has a built in system that  when a specific article is being edited by a user  it gets  locked   so no other user can edit it at the same time  if the user closes the window or lets the session expire without properly closing that article  clicking on  save  or  cancel   for example   that content gets  checked  and a lock icon is displayed in the backend next to it  which a superadmin will have to unlock   my question is   how is that added to a custom component that has its own content tables  as far as i ve been able to find  it looks to me that as long as you use jtable to manipulate that content  then that comes as a built in feature for methods in that class    is that right  or do i need to use something else like jtablecontent  do i need to add something to the tables used to store content  any specific columns   	you are correct  but you don t need to go down to jtable   if you re following the joomla way and using jcontrollerform as the basis for your view controller e g   class mycomponentcontrollermycontent extends jcontrollerform      and using jmodeladmin as the basis for you components model e g   class mycomponentmodelmycontent extends jmodeladmin      extending jcontrollerform   gives you a built in edit   method that sets up your model and table for you  and checks access to the record in question as well as whether the table supports checkouts  by checking that a column checked out exists   if it does  it attempts to checkout   the record via the model   by extending jmodeladmin you inherit it s getitem     checkin   and checkout   methods  as mentioned  the model calls checkout     which it inherits from jmodelform   and makes sure that in addition to the checked out column your table also has one called checked out time    at this point one of two things will happen if either of those columns don t exists  jmodelform fakes it and returns true  indicating job done   otherwise  it will grab the current users  and then proceed to attempt the checkout first checking if it s already checked out to another user  at this point if finally calls the jtable implementation of checkout    if you haven t overridden it in with your own table definition which in j3 isn t usually required    jtable performs exactly the same column checks  and if all is good  i e  has a valid id  updates the columns checked out and checked out time for the record being edited   as a side note  when you edit   an item  getitem   gets called  it loads the record via a jtable  i e  it does a gettable   followed by load  pk     at this point jtable also triggers your onbeforeload and onafterload events for plugins which is nice   the record is returned to your version of jmodeladmin   which converts it to a base stdclass object  it s used to be a jobject in times past   the if the record  now object  contains a params column attribute it converts that to a jregistry object for easy access   so  you get lots of handy things for free using the joomla way

usedbooks with a module called mod usedsearch  the user can view books by clicking a menu item called  used books    used books  which will show a paginated list or by searching it using a module from any page where they can filter it by author and author   i got the list view working but when i search with the module  i have two problems which i think are interrelated   when the search form in the module is submitted  it seems to be getting submitted to current component context  so if i am submitting the search form from the root url  i get a different query string     genre fiction author all option com usedbooks view search itemid 101   compared to when i submit the search form in the used books list page    used books genre fiction author all option com usedbooks view search itemid 108      in both cases  the list page with the correct filtered data is displayed but with one catch and that is when i click on page 2 on the pagination links  it goes to   used books fiction 0 author all start 5     my guess is that the problem lies in the router but i am struggling to find what it is  what i am trying to do is when the search form is submitted from any component context  it will be have a query string like  used books search  genre fiction author all and similarly for the pagination to be  used books search  genre fiction author all limit 5 and so on   i am not sure what i would

	i think i see the issue with the search module form destination url    the form action attribute needs the option and view parameters   i see you added them as hidden field at the end of the form   but try removing those fields and adding to the jroute url like so    form name  books search  action    php echo jroute     index php option com usedbooks view search      method  get     since these are crucial for the frame work properly routing the request  this should at least ensure the module form routes to the proper component and view

2014-11-26T19:57:06.707	5425	user-groups	are mutually exclusive user groups possible 	is it possible to prevent a user being in a particular user group if they are already in another   e g  a user cannot be a in  authors  if they re already in  administrator    not necessarily a practical example  but for the question  	as per the current behavior of joomla user can be in multiple usergroups and there is no hidden or inbuilt functionality available which can be utilized to implement such scenario   but obviously there are some alternates to everything   you can develop a plugin which will maintain a mapping of mutually exclusive user groups like user group a is mutually exclusive to user group b and so on   and on joomla userevents onuserbeforesave  you can check the difference between the usergroups and if there is any usergroup update which is not allowed then either return false in the event or redirect or show some error  whatever you like

2014-12-15T15:39:53.953	5682	authentication^&^iis	joomla doesn t know i m logged in on homepage	i m working on a joomla site and for some reason my site quit knowing it was logged in on the default page  other pages still know that i m logged in  even the default page knows i m logged in if i include index php in the url  for example  http   mysite proj index php home1 works but http   mysite proj  home1 does not  i know this was working a few days ago but it has stopped working for some reason and i have no idea why  i ve tried restoring to a point a few days ago and that has not worked but since i have no idea why this is happening it is difficult to even know how far back i need to go or weather this is even due to something i ve change with the file system   there is really not much to go on  i can tell you that neither the php log or the joomla logs are reporting anything  i have only one cookie set for the domain and it is for the root and appears to only contain a session id type hash string   update  after restoring a from the nightly backup made last night my site is suddenly working properly again  unfortunately  as far as i can tell this is the exact same setup i was using this morning which wasn t working  so now the nature of this question has changed slightly  now i m just looking for some sort of explanation as to how this could happen so that i can prevent it from happening again in the future   btw  while this was broken i had tried loading the page from ie and chrome on several machines on several networks  internal  external and my home   all produced the same error so i doubt this is a client issue   also  when i viewed the source the jmoddiv were all empty so this is probably not a style issue either  iow  they weren t hidden    update 2  i forgot to mention that i m on windows  i know  i don t like it either but despite my objections this isn t going to change  using iis5  so i m not using mod rewrite or  htaccess  files

2015-01-12T08:26:17.520	6952	joomla-3.3.x^&^security	conditional chmod values	i have been having troubles with the attackers attacking to my joomla sites  they create some php files which are encoded with base64 algorithm in the directories of which chmod values are 774 or higher   in order to upload pictures via administrator panel s media manager  i have to set images directory s chmod value to 774  so the attacker appends some malicious php files into this directory   i have an idea that could help but do not know how to do it  is it possible to set chmod to 774 right after logging into joomla administrator panel and set back to 755 after logging out   this is not a sharp solution but it reduces the probability of getting damage from attacks  	this is normally due to the folder having an owner different from what joomla is running under  the most common case is having php running under mod apache and having copied joomla  by ftp   there are three solutions  best first     change from apache to cgi fcgi php  this rans using your account which should match the folders  unfortunately this generally requires service provider action and they will generally refuse to do it  but you should ask anyway as they may agree or be able to move you to a server with different configuration  some server control panels allow the user to choose the php api used with apache being often the default since it uses somewhat less resources and used to be faster  configure joomla  to use ftp for file access in joomla  site settings  if you use same account  or an account in the same group   everything should work  the downside is that the ftp is somewhat painful to configure as finding the correct basepath can be a pain  if you have no prior experience  you can find it with php code and it is usually visible somewhere in the server control panel  ftp is also much slower  but writes are generally rare enough for this not to be a serious issue  change the owner of the image folder  chown works fine if you can use command line  otherwise just copy the folder  remove the original  and restore it using a php based file manager  the file manager would presumably ran under the same owner as joomla  and everything should work  the downside is that this messes up your security so you do not want to do it for all files and folders  but when installing updates joomla  actually occasionally needs to write to any folder and quite often to temp and cache    there is a related article http   www dionysopoulos me 2010 07   and lots of other articles on the web  this is one of the most common server issues

appeared to be the source of my problem      solution if host is dedictated  i thought that changing the changing the group from root to apache would fix the issue but nothing changed  after reading another post on joomla forum i saw someone change the owner of the folders and files  so after i ran the following   sudo chown  r apache apache  var www html    then  after refreshing my screen  i see the colour green again      so the files on the root of my web directory are set for permissions with 744  folders with 755 and files in said folders are 644  think i m all set for now    succesfully installed the first plugin on my site  off to the races with me   solution if shared host   will post something more verbose once its complete but a good read comes from dionysopoulos which is linked in this answer 4   it talks about permission pitfalls and why my dedicated host solution is bad in general and especially bad for shared host providers

2015-01-19T02:03:57.827	7037	joomla-3.x^&^security^&^apache^&^permissions	permissions and ownership	so everyone and there cat is on about permissions in the web folder structure  popular question is the one about recommended practices   great post and i understand the importance of setting 755 for directories and 644 for files  even the joomla recommended settings refer to those permission sets  i have done this and that is easy    this is very related to another question of mine where i was trying to get the directory permissions permissions set to writable  initially i set the owner of my entire website to  apache  which worked  however i have since learned that is a bad practice even on a dedicated hosting environment    a blog post by dionysopoulos talks about how to change this using the owner and  htaccess files  on the off change that post is ever broken the steps he suggests are listed below      the correct approach is painful and time consuming  you need all your   files and directories owned by your account s user  i e  use ftp to   upload them  except those you need to be able to write to  since we re   talking joomla  here  do the following     remove the cache  tmp and logs directories install joomla  extplorer or ninjaxplorer on your site  these file managers run inside joomla   ergo under the same user and group as your web server  create the cache  tmp and logs directories using either of these file managers  these directories are now owned by the web server user  give them temporarily 777 permissions  again using these file managers  use your favourite ftp program to create a  htaccess file inside each of these directories with the following contents    order deny  allow deny from all   give that file 0644 permissions using the ftp program  go back to the file manager  extplorer or ninjaxplorer  and give the cache  tmp and logs directories 0700 permissions  note  you may need to give 0744 permissions to the cache directory and remove the  htaccess file for some css js aggregation   compression plugins to work  i consider this an awful practice  but it seems to be the only workaround  if you ask for myopinion  uninstall the plugin in question  go to joomla  s global configuration and enable the ftp layer  do not store your password    getting to the point  as of this moment the only writable directories i have are cache  tmp and log which are protect by  htaccess based on the above instructions  the part i m fuzzy on is  you need all your files and directories owned by your account s user   currently that is set to root  i want to do this right  it hasn t taken long to see that joomla security is very important  below is the ll   jrt and wood are my tmp and log respectively  i read they should be changed from their defaults    drwxr xr x  10 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 administrator drwxr xr x   2 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 bin drwxr xr x   2 apache apache  4096 jan 18 20 07 cache drwxr xr x   2 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 cli drwxr xr x  19 root   apache  4096 jan 18 19 39 components  rw r  r     1 root   apache  2750 jan 16 20 39 configuration php  rw r  r     1 root   apache  2859 oct  1 06 52 htaccess txt drwxr xr x   5 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 images drwxr xr x   2 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 includes  rw r  r     1 root   apache  1013 oct  1 06 52 index php  rw r  r     1 root   apache  1910 oct  1 06 52 joomla xml drwxr xr x   2 apache apache  4096 jan 18 20 04 jrt drwxr xr x   4 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 language drwxr xr x   4 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 layouts drwxr xr x  14 root   apache  4096 jan 17 23 38 libraries  rw r  r     1 root   apache 17816 oct  1 06 52 license txt drwxr xr x  20 root   apache  4096 jan 17 23 38 media drwxr xr x  28 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 modules drwxr xr x  15 root   apache  4096 jan 17 23 28 plugins  rw r  r     1 root   apache  4310 oct  1 06 52 readme txt  rw r  r     1 root   apache   842 oct  1 06 52 robots txt dist drwxr xr x   5 root   apache  4096 oct  1 06 52 templates  rw r  r     1 root   apache    86 jan 17 16 49 test php  rw r  r     1 root   apache  1609 oct  1 06 52 web config txt drwxr xr x   2 apache apache  4096 jan 18 20 06 wood   who should the owner be of directories that don t need to be writable all the time

accessing the page via http    e g  the solution displayed all 3 digits of a version of joomla  e g  2 5 28  or 1 0 x and so on by only accessing the webpage via http   i want to create a small application to be informed about the version installed on the server  since i do not have always full access to the ftp storage  i would like to know how i can extract the joomla version from a simple http get  	ok so this is what i was writing yesterday   for joomla 2 5 and 3 x only   check if the http    prefix is missing from the url  if it is  then it adds it  note that in this case i have not taken https    into consideration  it then tries to get the joomla manifest file and checks whether is exists is readable  if it exists then it gets the value from the  version  tag  if the xml file is not readable  then i have written a fallback to get the tinymce version  again  it will try to read the value from the  version  tag  from here on  i spent quite a long time going through the release notes for each joomla version to see which versions has a tinymce update  those that did  i added to the switch block further own in the code  this approach will not give the exact version apart from 2 of them  but it will give an average  i was thinking about detecting the jquery version but then realised that a lot of people update the core version to the latest which would then make the results inaccurate  if the tinymce version cannot be found  so basically a non joomla site   then the function will return unknown     note  this script uses curl so make sure it s enabled on yourserver    class joomlaversions       public function getjoomlaversion  site                   add http prefix if missing         if  strpos  site  http          false                         site

2015-01-22T19:30:07.823	7149	development^&^jmenu	how can i temporarily change the article id of a menu item within php 	i need to be able to get a menu item based on the itemid  then temporarily override one of the values used in the query string in the php  and finally generate the link that joomla would then use   i do not want to change the actual menu item  or have alternate menu items  etc   the actual requirement is a bit complicated  so for the sake of simplicity  let s say that i need to use article id  1 during the day  and article id 2 after 6 00pm   so the actually menu item is  option com content view article id 1 itemid 100  if it s after 6 00pm  i need something like  menu  getitem  itemid   link to return option com content view article id 2 itemid 100 instead   i ve been trying this with  app  getmenu    and new jmenu   but am obviously missing something   i would imagine the code would be something like this    menu    app  getmenu     menuitem    menu  getitem 100    menu  setproperties  the article id  2    templink    menuitem  link      templink should be  option com content view article id 2 itemid 100    continue my processing with  templink   to clarify  the highly specialized actual requirement is essentially generating a series of links based on existing menu items  who they are  and where they are on the site  thus using jinput and or redirecting is not an option   getting and manipulating the menu object is necessary to come up with the various links i need to display  not actually going to them  unless the user clicks on one which has been displayed to them   	there are no hooks for jmenu  getitem   or jmenu  load     depending on your interest you could write a plugin which hooks into the routing

2015-02-02T00:34:35.383	7401	joomla-3.x^&^category^&^non-sef-url	does joomla 3 automatically create a non sef url when a category is created 	in sh404sef url manager i noticed that a sef url had been created for a page i had no menu item for  the non sef url was index php option com content id 27 lang en view category  i ve since created new categories and found corresponding non sef urls  so it seems joomla is automatically creating these links   anyway just to be sure     does joomla automatically create a non sef url when a category is created  if yes   this might seem like blasphemy  but   is there a way to prevent this    misc the reason i d want to prevent the non sef url is because in the past i ve sometimes created articles for use as category pages  again probably blasphemy because i should probably be using a layout override   	it is best to not think of joomla as  creating these links  and instead recognizing that there are a variety of urls that joomla can understand and load a page from   the non sef url represents the variables that any sef url gets translated into  the only piece that is missing from your url would be an itemid which corresponds to the menu item id   i haven t actually used any solution to try to prevent these types of urls from working  your best bet is to actually check for the url early in a page load  probably using a system plugin   pass the url through jroute  which will convert it to a search engine friendly url if possible and enabled   and then redirect to that url if the urls don t match   this should not be done for posts  since the post data would be lost in the redirect most likely  and may lead to some weird issues possibly  not sure that jroute is always super precise  so you may get multiple answers for similar urls    finally  there may already be plugins like this one http   extensions joomla org profile extension site management seo a metadata canonical url that do something similar   never tried this one  just googled a touch

2015-02-20T07:14:56.720	8712	joomla-3.x^&^model^&^jtable	what does jtable s bind function do and why it is useful 	when writing a view which either edits creates a record  the model extends admin model which requires gettable   and getform       now the confusion is how the loadform   function knows the number of fields in the table associated with the model and what the role of the bind   function is   it s not clear to me how the table class and form talk to each other and where 	your form is defined by your xml form  typically located in models forms   you choose to have the same names as those in your database as those field names but actually it isn t compulsory   you can think of the table as being like a wrapper around a row to insert  you go through a 3 stage process   bind takes the array of data that comes from your form and then stores any data from it into the table class   check then runs sanity checks on the data that you have binded into the table class  store then stores the binded data into the database table   however what s important is the data that is stored in the class  this means that the names of the fields in your form are to an extent irrelevent  for example  you could have a field in your form called foobar and then in your bind method do   public function bind  src   ignore   array           this  tablevar    src  foobar        parent  bind  src   ignore       and this will try and store the foobar variable from your form as a column called tablevar in your database  edit   this is because the parent bind method will bind data to the class as a class var  public function bind  src   ignore   array          foreach   src as  field     value                 this   field    value            and then will attempt to match  field to a database column storing the value if it exists  so the importance of setting  this  tablevar above is that is the column in your database was tablevar and you didn t have a column called foobar then now it gets stored into the database

2015-02-21T23:10:21.953	8736	joomla-3.x^&^access	get access level for a url	how could i get access level for a given url  i need to know if a url is accessible for registered or only guests  	i don t think there is info about the access on the url level  nor there is a  global   thing  that controls the access of any url page  so you can fetch this info in a list    some brief background information on acl  anyone please correct me if that s no correct     access levels occurs much lower in the system   it works on each component and its content elements   with acl you don t set access on urls  rather you do it on content elements individually   usually the components have options to specify the access levels for their content items   which are stored in the associative items table in the database   after requesting a page through a url  joomla will return the content of this page based on the url query  which usually specifies a component  a view and a content item  usually the component s code that is responsible to display the above content  will check the access level of the content item stored in the database and compare it with the current user s view access level  in order to decide if it will show or not the content to that user   so  this concludes regarding to the acl  that what you need to check  is about specific content items access levels     current menu item s access level  what i can think is close to what you might want  is to check the menu item s access level   since menu items play big role in displaying content and building urls   but keep in mind that there can be so many situations  where a menu item could have a public access level  while the included content being in a restricted level   in any case  if you need to check the access level for a menu item  you can go like this    app   jfactory  getapplication     menu    app  getmenu     menuactive    menu  getactive     menuactive  access      get article access level by id  for an article you can go like this   jimport  joomla application component model    jmodellegacy  addincludepath jpath site   components com content models     articlemodel   jmodellegacy  getinstance   article    contentmodel      article    articlemodel  getitem  articleid    article  access     it would help to get even better answer  if you would specify from where you want to get this information and describe what you are trying to achieve

2015-02-24T15:08:59.850	8764	menu-item^&^itemid	why does category view use home page itemid when displaying the articles 	from the home page of v3 3 6  i have a category view listing all the sub categories of a given main category   when i click on that link from the home page  it lists those sub categories as expected  but the links of those subcategories  to see the articles within them  all use the itemid of the home page   not that of the currently displayed category view page  the correct itemid is  of course  the browser url    correct  links    home page  index php option com content view article id 107 itemid  435 cat  view  index php option com content view categories id 80 itemid  531   these are the  incorrect  links to sub categories that are displayed on the cat  view  they are using itemid 435 from home page  not 531 from the currently displayed view of the main category as would be expected    subcat1   index php option com content view category id 81 itemid  435 subcat2   index php option com content view category id 82 itemid  435 subcat3   index php option com content view category id 83 itemid  435   sef is not turned on  nor any multiple language settings and there are no menu item aliases in play   i ve changed the main menu item type to various other components other than com content to see if that would make a difference  though the article specified in the home page is uncategorized  thus not expected to appear in any of the article lists anyways   am i wrong in assuming that the list of links should be using the itemid of the currently active page and associated itemid  531    this seems like such an elementary question  i feel silly asking  but there seem to be no clear answers or settings to get any other behavior  	it considers that you have already created a menu item   your current category list menu item  which becomes an  authoritative  itemid for the content you are linking   it is also possible that you are going to have further similar issues with any article of your main top category  as they might use the itemid of your home page now  instead of the category s blog menu item id   a brief conclusion i have on this   without reviewing the code behind the mechanism   therefore not being 100  sure on this   is that a lower id will take precedence over a higher id  when there are 2 similar type menu items that link the same content  which most likely describe your case here   it will be interesting to make your own tests on this and see if this is really seems to be the case here   after all  the general conclusion is that you can have extended control over the itemids  by creating menu items for each of the content element you need to display it under specific itemid  with keeping in mind that having 2 similar content elements  like same category  linked from 2 different menu items  looks like the lower itemid will be used   update   do this test   based on the above  here is something that you could try that might be also the solution in the case you don t want to create more menu items    create a new menu item   category list and set this as  default   home page     therefore a higher itemid  disable or make your old home menu item the  category blog  menu item that holds the parent category  see which itemid is used now

2015-02-25T11:16:21.030	8775	joomla-2.5^&^administrator	joomla administrator   sub menus are getting displayed 6 times instead of one 	whenever i select a category like users content etc from administrator area the submenus are getting displayed 6 times  like the below picture for users     debug  administrator template  hathor index php  line 92    jdoc include type  modules  name  submenu  style  rounded  id  submenu box     var dump  test      this is where the mod submenu is included and the submenus are displayed after the var dump i get only one output  wanted to test if i were inside a loop    so i thought that the problem would be inside the mod submenu    altough i noticed that the whole code of mod submenu is executed inside a    ul id  submenu     but the output after i inspected the page is this for each line     div id  submenu box        div class  m            ul id  submenu    ul    if the mod submenu was executed 6 times i would have something like that for output    div id  submenu box       div class  m          ul id  submenu    ul         ul id  submenu    ul         ul id  submenu    ul     etc     now the output is this     div id  submenu box           div class  m              ul id  submenu    ul           div        div       div id  submenu box           div class  m              ul id  submenu    ul           div        div       div id  submenu box           div class  m              ul id  submenu    ul           div        div      etc      so if im not mistaken  jdoc include type  modules  name  submenu  style  rounded  id  submenu box     creates both  div id  submenu box   and  div class  m      after alot of debugging i came to the conclusion that the include statement and only that   the rest code of hathor is running normally   is executed 5 more times   i thought of getting rid of the 5 extra divs using jquery  altough the problem is that there are 6 divs with the same id  so i tried to change the id  submenu box  on include to class  submenu box    after i refreshed the page  instead of having a  div class  submenu box   i had an empty  div    cant i use a class with the jdoc include    has anyone encountered something like that before   or anyone has any idea what could be the problem    i hope i was clear enough   p s  error log is empty   	i had something like this in the past  and the reason was that the module had more than 1 instances in the db    why don t you check in module manager    admin modules  to see if you have the same admin module  submenu  many times   if you can t see them in the module manager  consider checking also directly in the db   in my case  what it caused that issue  was a sql   database fix statement that i run directly in the db  after updating joomla that has db structure issues  and was not possible to fix those issues with the db  fix schemas structure in the backend   although i updated joomla db schemas  i also duplicated a couple of admin modules

2015-02-28T19:57:34.153	8827	module^&^articles	update article hits through newsflash module 	so  the article hits for an article don t update if the article is viewed via the newsflash module  anybody know how to make the article hits increase each time said article is loaded via the newsflash module  currently  you have to actually open the article page for the hits to increase  but they won t if the article is just viewed through a newsflash module   many thanks in advance 	as i check in the code i don t see the module updating article hits any where  but i think article should only be updated its hits when we view full article s detail  so i think this module shouldn t update article hits   this module calls oncontentafterdisplay and oncontentbeforedisplay events  so you can build a custom plugin to update article hits by catching these events from the module  and yes this requires programming

2015-03-07T18:00:18.150	8948	component	how to retrieve id of newly added row in jmodeladmin 	i am modifying a component  in its model file  it creates a class that extends jmodeladmin  in its save   function  it takes form data  then calls parent save    i am trying to get the id of the newly added row    i am new to joomla  but i know the  this variable should contain relevant info   this  id does not return the newly created id  but rather  0  i think this makes sense since  this would not know about the id created in the parent save function   so what do i do to get the id from the parent save   thanks  brian 	
2015-03-07T23:59:47.423	8953	sef^&^jroute	using jroute in the backend  almost figured it out  help needed	i needed to get jroute working in backend so that from admin i can create an event with my event component and have an email sent that contains the sef url  after researching  i found some tips that involve setting the app instance to site  call jroute  then set app back to admin  however  while i am getting the sef url  something isn t quite right during the redirect after the event creation   here is how i do this  which is basically a copy from an older post i found    live site   substr juri  root    0   1       if jpath base    jpath administrator               in the back end we need to set the application to the site app instead in order for jroute to work         jfactory   application   japplication  getinstance  site                  create the url      url    live site   jroute     index php option com icagenda view list layout event id      id     itemid      itemid           check if we are in the backend again     if jpath base    jpath administrator                in backend we need to remove administrator from url as it is added even though we ve set the application to the site app          eventlink  str replace  live site    administrator    live site   url              set the appilcation back to the administartor app         jfactory   application   japplication  getinstance  administrator                           the above seems to work  but the problem is during the redirect  after the event has been created and the email sent  normally  the event view page in admin has this type of url   administrator index php option com icagenda layout edit id 23  but because of the japplication  getinstance business  the redirect url is messed up and i get a 500 error  the messed up url has this form  administrator index php component icagenda  view event layout edit id 23  i think maybe the solution i pasted was from joomla 1 5 and so maybe i need to do something differently in 3    any ideas   thanks
