A SIMPLE TRAINING RUN (POSTERIOR INFERENCE)
---------------------
Files:
-----
Files I made: data_train, data_train_vocab (see below).
Files hdp produced: train_dir/*
   These 2 files and 1 dir were named by me when I created them.
   The dir name was determined by me and I sent it as a parameter to
   hdp, which created and filled the directory.
Files print.topics.R produced:  TOPICS_TRAIN
   This file was named by me and sent as a parameter to print.topics.R
   which created it and filled it in.

The Run:
--------
I ran training with file data_train and said to put results into dir train_dir
as follows:  
hdp --algorithm train --data data_train --directory train_dir

data_train is the data file. One row per document. So row, say, 3, gives
information about document 3. Say row 3 looked like this:
10 0:2  1:1  2:2  3:1  4:1  5:1  6:1  7:0  8:0  9:99
That would mean that document 3 has 10 different words in it.
These words are numbered from 0 to 9 (the numbers before the ":"s).
So here, word 0 occurs 2 times in document 3
So here, word 1 occurs 1 times in document 3
So here, word 2 occurs 2 times in document 3
So here, word 3 occurs 1 times in document 3
So here, word 4 occurs 1 times in document 3
...
So here, word 9 occurs 99 times in document 3
That's the format this hdp program expects for its input file.

So what IS word 0, word 1, etc?
This is given by some other file, which lists the words in the same
order as above (as in data_train, the file used to do the hdp).
I called that file data_train_vocab. Thus data_train_vocab allows
us to decode the integer assignment of words used in data_train.
e.g., the data_train_vocab file (for the data_train file) is:
dog
mouse
bird
cat
fish
parrot
durmat
bat
horse
mule
This means that dog is word 0, mouse is word 1, etc. 

AFTER we run hdp as above, it puts results in directory 
   train_dir (because of the --directory train_dir flag).
Inside train_dir is a file called mode-topics.dat
That file contains the output mode-topics.dat which contains those results 
with the largest joint likelihood ever seen during the gibbs sampling. 

Topics:
-------
SO WHAT ARE THE TOPICS_TRAIN FOUND by hdp??

Run the R program print.topics.R to see. I ran as follows:
print.topics.R train_dir/mode-topics.dat data_train_vocab TOPICS_TRAIN 4

Note that mode-topics.dat was produced by the hdp run above and put into
     directory train_dir.
Also, data_train_vocab is above (so it knows what text is word 0, word 1, etc.)
Also, TOPICS_TRAIN is just the output file it writes its results into.
Also, the "4" means I want it to list the top 4 words in each topic

After I ran this, TOPICS_TRAIN contained:

                   1                   2
                mule               mouse
                 dog                 dog
                bird                bird
                 cat              parrot
This is telling me it found two topics. And it showed me the top 4 words in
each (the 4 was a parameter I sent to print.topics.R above)

Some of the files in train_dir give more specific info (like the percentage
of "mule" in topic 1 etc.)

A SIMPLE NEW DATA INFERENCE RUN (NEW DATA)
------------------------------------------

Make another data file, corresponding vocab file, and pick a dir name. I did:
Files:
data:  the new data file. Note that it uses the same vocab file as data_train
TOPICS_TEST: same as TOPICS_TRAIN above, but for the new data.
Dir:
test_dir: named by me and sent as parameter to hdp, which creates and fills it

Note that to run hdp for new data, it needs the saved training model. This is
in file train_dir/mode.bin (it was created by hdp during the training run.)

Ran it as:
hdp --algorithm test --data data --saved_model train_dir/mode.bin --directory test_dir

Then looked at results by:

print.topics.R test_dir/test-mode-topics.dat data_train_vocab TOPICS_TEST 4

The TOPICS_TEST produced was:

                   1                   2                   3
                mule               mouse              parrot
                 dog                 dog               mouse
                bird                bird                fish
                fish              parrot                bird
