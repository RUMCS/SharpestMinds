the nine .bin files are the models saved during the iterations and
mode.bin is the model with the highest likelihood. All of them can be
used for inference. For example, if you want to monitor how the model
performs on the test set during the iterations, you can use those nine
bin files. (There could be more bin files if you use more iterations).

mode-*.dat indicate those results with the largest joint likelihood
ever seen during the gibbs sampling. and 00400-like files are the
results for that iteration.

you are right!

yes, see README file for details on how to read this file.

topics.dat is the output file of the topics. you give a file name (for
example, topics.dat), it will print the topics to that file.
