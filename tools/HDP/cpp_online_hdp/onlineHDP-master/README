This C++ code implements the online variational bayes for hierachical dirichlet process presented in paper "Online Variational Inference for the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process", Chong Wang John Paisley David M. Blei. This C++ version of the code is implemented based on the python version of the code released by Chong Wang. 


This code requires
Eigen 3 and Boost library

Eigen 3 could be downloaded here:

Build instructions:

cd build
cmake ..
make


Example data are provided in the data/ folder. This is the preprocessed Reuters R8 data set. 
Data are presented as wordid:counts, and each line is a document.

Example command line to run the code:
